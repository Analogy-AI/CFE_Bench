      "text": "In your study of a new bacterial species you have identified a transducing phage that you call Px. In addition you have worked out methods to make random transposon insertions into the bacterial genome. You have generated two different transposon insertion collections one with $10^5$ random $Tn5 (Kan^r)$ insertions and the other with $10^5$ random $Tn10 (Tet^r)$ insertions. You grow Px phage on the mixed collection of Tn5 insertions and use the resulting phage lysate to infect the mixed collection of Tn10 insertions. You select $10,000 Kan^r$ transductants and find that 80 of them are $Tet^s$. Use this information to estimate the total size of the bacterial genome assuming that both Tn5 and Tn10 insert randomly and that the average size of a fragment recombined into the recipient geneome during Px transduction is 55 kbp. (Tn5 is about 5 kbp and Tn10 is 10 kbp.)",

    "answer": {
      "text": "A KanR, TetR transductant results when recombination of the Tn5 occurs in the genome in a place not overlapping with the insertion site of Tn10. This happens 9920/10000 times, or 99.2% of the time. Similarly, A KanR, TetS transductant results when recombination of Tn5 occurs in the genome in a place overlapping with the insertion site of Tn10, thus disrupting the TetR gene . This happens 80/10000 times, or 0.8% of the time.\n\n\n\nWe are told that the average size of a recombined fragment is 55kbp, this means that a phage head can fit 55 kbp of DNA, which is larger than either Tn10 or Tn5. We can find the size of the genome by seeing that 55kbp is proportional to the size of the genome just as 0.8% is proportional to 100% (0.8% recombination tells us the phage is holding 0.8%of the genome). However, before we can use 55kpb to find the genome size, we must subtract the 5kbp of Tn5. We subtract off 5kbp because there is no Tn5 in the genome,so there is no possibility of recombination within this region. Therefore, it is not counted in our measurement of recomination.\n\n\n\nTherefore:$80/10,000=0.008=$ the probability that the 50 kbp phage DNA with Tn5recombined into a spot overlapping Tn10.\n\n\n\n$0.008/50=1/(total genuine length)$ 1--> from this we get a total genome lenth of 6250kbp.\n\n\nnote: A common mistake would be to subtract the size of the Tn10 off of the final answer. This is not correct, because it was never included in the 6250kbp in the frst place, as there is no Tn10 in the 55kbp of DNA and there was never a chance of recombination.",

For example xxx, xx, and x are equivalent, but these are only full if $n=1$ Suppose T is a set of strings such that any full string is equivalent to exactly one element of T.Determine the number of elements of T.",

Then $x\\times y$ takes the larger of $\\{x,y\\}$ ,and in the event of a tie picks either \"left\" or $ ``right_{right}''$ , where the choice of side is fixed among elements of each size.\n First solution (Steven Hao). The main trick is the two lemmas, which are not hard to show (and are motivated by our conjecture).\n$$\\begin{aligned}x x&=x\\\\x y x z x&=x y z x.\\end{aligned}$$\nConsequently, define a double rainbow to be the concatenation of two full strings of length $n$ , of which there are $(n!)^{2}$ . We claim that these form equivalence classes for T .\nTo see that any string s is equivalent to a double rainbow, note that $s=s s$ , and hence using the second identity above repeatedly lets us reduce ss to a double rainbow.\nTo see two distinct double rainbows $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ aren't equivalent, one can use the construction mentioned in the beginning. Specifically, take two variables a and b which do not appear in the same order in $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ . Then it's not hard to see that abab, abba,baab, baba are pairwise non-equivalent by choosing $ \\text{\"left\"}$ or \"right\" appropriately. Now construct \\times on the whole set by having a and b be the largest variables, so the rest of the variables don't matter in the evaluation of the string.\n Second solution outline (Ankan Bhattacharya). We outline a proof of the characterization claimed earlier, which will also give the answer $(n!)^{2}$ . We say $a\\sim b$ if ab $\\neq$ ba.Also, say $a>b{\\mathrm{~i f~}}a b=b a=a$ .. The following are proved by finite casework, using the fact that $\\{a b,b c,c a\\}$ ·always has exactly two distinct elements for any different b $a,b,$ C.\n· If $a>b$ and $b>c$ then $a>c$ \nIf $a\\sim b$ and $b\\sim c$ then $a b=a$ if and only if $b c=b$ \n•If $a\\sim b$ and $b\\sim c$ then $a\\sim c.$ \n•If $a\\sim b$ and $a>c$ then $b>c$ \n•If $a\\sim b$ and $c>a$ then $c>b$ \nThis gives us the total ordering on the elements and the equivalence classes by ~. In this we way can check the claimed operations are the only ones.\nWe can then (as in the first solution) verify that every full string is equivalent to a unique double rainbow — but this time we prove it by simply considering all possible \\times,because we have classified them all.",

Now, we will describe a strategy that enables Red to win in 4 moves. First, Red places a point $r_{1}$ and then Blue places a point $b_{1}$. Then, Red places a point $r_{2}$ such that $r_{1},r_{2}$, and $b_{1}$ are not collinear. Blue must now place a point $b_{2}$ between $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ in order to avoid losing immediately. Red must now place a point $r_{3}$ such that it forms two distinct lines of two red points (e.g., $r_1, r_3$ and $r_2, r_3$). For example, place $r_3$ such that $r_1, r_3$ and $r_2, r_3$ are potential winning lines. Blue can only block one of these lines with their next move $b_3$. Red can then place their 4th point $r_4$ on the unblocked line to win. Therefore, Red needs 4 moves to guarantee a win.",

      "images": []

    "answer": {
      "text": "Let $P(A)$ (let's call this power, A is a point in space) be a function returning the radius of inversion with center A. Note that the power of endpoints of 1D very sets are equal,and these powers are the highest out of all points in the very set. Let the convex hull of our very set be H. Let the vertices be $A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{m}$ . (We have $m\\geq3$ since the points are not collinear.) Since $A_{1},A_{2}$ are endpoints of a 1D very set, they have equal power. Going around the hull, all vertices have equal power. ### Lemma 2. Other than the vertices, no other points lie on the edqes of H, and H is equilateral Proof. Say X is on $A_{1}A_{2}$ . Then (cd $X,A_{3}$ are on opposite ends of a 1D very set, so they have equal power. Then $P(X)=P(A_1)=P(A_2)$ Icontradicting the fact the endpoints have the unique highest power. Therefore, since all sides only have 2 points on them, and all vertices have equal power, all sides are equal. ### Lemma 3. H is a regular polygon Proof. Let's look at the segment $A_{1}A_{3}$ . Say that on it we have a very set of size $k-1$ . By uniqueness and the construction in (a), and the fact that $P(A_{1})=P(A_{2})=P(A_{3})$ , we get that $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$ are 3 vertices of a regular k-gon. Now the very set on segment $A_{1}A_{3}$ under inversion at $A_{2}$ would map to a regular k-gon. So all vertices of this regular k-gon would be in our set. Assuming that not all angles are equal taking the largest angle who is adjacent to a smaller angle, we contradict convexity. So all angles are equal. Combining this with Lemma 1, H is a regular polygon.□ ### Lemma 4. H cannot have more than 4 vertices Proof. Firstly, note that no points can be strictly any of the triangles $A_{i}A_{i+1}A_{i+2}$ : (*) Or else, inverting with center $A_{i+1}$ . we get a point outside H. First, let's do if m (number of vertices) is odd. Let $m=2k+1.\\quad(k\\geq2)$ Look at the inversive image of $A_{2k+1}$ under inversion with center $A_{2}$ . Say it maps to X. Note that $P(X)<P(A_{i})$ for any i. Now look at the line $A_{k+2}X$ . Since $A_{k+2}$ is an endpoint, but $P(X)<P(A_{k+2})$ ,the other endpoint of this 1D very set must be on ray $A_{k+2}X$ past X, contradicting (*), since no other vertices of H are on this ray. Similarly for m even and $\\geq6$ we can also find 2 points like these who contain no other vertices in H on the line through them.□Lemma 5. We only have 2 distinct very sets in 2D (up to scaling), an equilateral triangle $(w h e n~n=3)$ and a square with its center (when $n=5.$ ). Proof. First if H has 3 points, then by (*) in Lemma 3, no other points can lie inside H. So we get an equilateral triangle. If H has 4 points, then by (*) in Lemma 3, the only other point that we can add into our set is the center of the square. This also must be added, and this gives a very set of size 5. Hence, the maximal size is 5.",

Although we won't have finished proving this by the time you work on this problem set, for now assume the theorem above is true. In all of the problems below, C will be a nonsingular cubic curve in Weierstrass normal form,i.e. the solution set to $y^{2}=f(x)=x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c$ where $f(x)$ has distinct roots. We always take the zero element of the group to be the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}=[0,1,0]$ In this problem we allow the coefficients a, b, c of $f(x)$ to lie in the real numbers R. We saw in class that $C:y^{2}=f(x)$ has 9 points of order dividing 3 if one allows complex coefficients. In this problem we are going to see how many of these points have real coefficients.

      "text": "We saw in class that $\\psi(x)$ has 4 distinct roots (over the complex numbers.) Consider the local extrema of $\\psi$; these occur at points x where $\\psi^{\\prime}(x)=0$ . Also, we note that $\\psi^{\\prime}(x)=12f(x)$ By the mean value theorem, between any two values $\\alpha_{1}<\\alpha_{2}$ such that $\\psi(\\alpha_{1})=\\psi(\\alpha_{2})=0$ , there must be a $\\alpha_{1}<\\beta<\\alpha_{2}$ with $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\beta)=0$ . In other words, between any two zeroes of $\\psi$ lies a local extremum. Now suppose $\\alpha$ is a value such that $\\psi(x)$ has a local extremum at $\\alpha,$ So $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\alpha)=12f(\\alpha)=0.$ , and so $f(\\alpha)=0$ . Then $\\psi(\\alpha)=-f^{\\prime}(\\alpha)^{2}\\leq0$ . Moreover, if $\\psi(\\alpha)=0$ ,then $f^{\\prime}(\\alpha)=0$ , so that f and $f^{\\prime}$ have a common root $\\alpha$, contradicting the fact that the curve C is assumed to be nonsingular. Thus actually $\\psi(\\alpha)<0$ at any value of $\\alpha$ where $\\psi$ has a local maximum or minimum. But since the leading term of $\\psi(x)$ is $3x^{4}$ , we definitely have that $\\operatorname*{l i m}_{x\\to\\infty}\\psi(x)\\,\\text{=}\\,\\infty$ and $\\operatorname{l i m}_{x\\to-\\infty}\\psi(x)=\\infty$ From all of this, we conclude that $\\psi$ has precisely two real roots, say $\\alpha_{1}<\\alpha_{2}$ and that $\\psi(a)<0$ for all $\\alpha_{1}<a<\\alpha_{2}$ , with all of the local extrema occurring in this range. In particular, $\\psi$ is decreasing at $x=\\alpha_{1}$ and increasing at $x=\\alpha_{2}$ Since $\\psi^{\\prime}=f$ ., we see that $f(\\alpha_{1})<0<f(\\alpha_{2})$ Then the points of order 3 with real x-coordinate are $(\\alpha_{1},\\pm\\sqrt{f(\\alpha_{1})})$ and $(\\alpha_{2},\\pm\\sqrt{f(\\alpha_{2})})$ ). But only the two points $(\\alpha_{2},\\pm\\sqrt{f(\\alpha_{2})}$ have real y-coordinate. Together with O, these form exactly 3 points of order dividing 3 with coefficients in R.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "The largest possible value of N is $\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{12}}n^{2}(n^{2}-1)$ 1. Call these rectangles wobbly. We defer the construction until the proof is complete, since the proof suggests the construction. Proof of bound. Call a triple of integers $(a,b,c)$ an elbow if a and b are in the same row, b and c are in the same column, and $a<b>c$ . Observe that the wobbly rectangles are exactly the ones with 2 elbows. Claim— Every axis-aligned rectangle has at least 1 elbow. Proof. The smallest integer in any rectangle is the center of an elbow. □ Remark. In fact, it is true that any rectangle must have exactly 1 or 2 elbows. However,this fact is not needed in the proof. Let E be the number of elbows and M be the number of non-wobbly rectangles. Then,the number of elbows is at least $M+2N={\\binom{n}{2}}^{2}+N$ ,so $$E\\geq{\\binom{n}{2}}^{2}+N\\iff N\\leq E-{\\binom{n}{2}}^{2}.$$ To this end, we will provide an upper bound on E. For each cell c, define: $f(c)$ to be the number of cells in c's row which are smaller than c, and $g(c)$ to be the number of cells in c's column which are smaller than c. Then, the number of elbows centered at c equals $f(c)g(c)$ . Thus, the number of elbows satisfies $$\\begin{aligned}E&=\\sum_{c}f(c)g(c)\\\\&\\leq\\sum_{c}\\frac{1}{2}\\big[f(c)^2+g(c)^2\\big]\\\\&=n(0^2+\\cdots+(n-1)^2)\\\\&=\\frac{n^2(n-1)(2n-1)}{6}.\\end{aligned}$$ It follows that the number of wobbly rectangles satisfies $$N\\leq E-{\\binom{n}{2}}^{2}$$ $$\\begin{aligned}&\\leq\\frac{n^{2}(n-1)(2n-1)}{6}-\\frac{n^{2}(n-1)^{2}}{4}\\\\ &=\\frac{n^{2}(n^{2}-1)}{12}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ as desired. Construction. From the proof above, equality holds if and only if $f(c)\\;=\\;g(c)$ everywhere. Select any $n\\times n$ . Latin square on symbols $0,\\ldots,n-1$ , and replace the n copies of symbol k with the integers $k n+1,\\ldots,k n+n$ in some order. This construction is valid,because for each cel $c,f(c)$ and $g(c)$ both equal the symbol originally placed in c. Here is an example for $n=6$ . The left grid is the Latin square, and the right grid is one possible table that can be derived from it. <table border=\"1\"><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>19</td><td>25</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>26</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>15</td><td>21</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>22</td><td>28</td><td>34</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>17</td><td>23</td><td>29</td><td>35</td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>24</td><td>30</td><td>36</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr></table> Remark (Structure of optimal tables).In fact, any optimal table must lead to a Latin square in a similar way, by reversing the above idea: replace each cell c with $f(c)=g(c)$ This suggests how to construct all optimal tables: choose any Latin square on 0, . ..,$n-1$ , and fill in the cells so that the relative order of cells in every row and column is preserved. Remark.If the grid is filled out in a random order, the expected number of wobbly rectangles is $\\scriptscriptstyle{\\frac{1}{12}}n^{2}{\\stackrel{-}{(}}n-1)^{2}$ .

Suppose at the beginning of some round, the first glass contains w pints of wine,$0\\leq w\\leq1$ and $1-w$ pints of water. The second glass contains the rest of the wine and water.\n\nPouring $1/3$ pint from first glass to second leaves $2/3$ pints of liquid and $(2/3)$ w wine in the first glass, and $4/3$ pints of liquid and $1-(2/3)u$ wine in the second glass. Pouring $1/3$ pint back from second into first transfers a proportion of $(1/3)/(4/3)$ of the wine in the second glass into the first.So the round completes with both glasses containing a pint of liquid, and the first glass containing \n$$(2/3)w+(1/4)(1-(2/3)w)=1/4+w/2$$\npints of wine.

Initially, the wizard places all cards face down in a row, in unknown order.You may repeatedly make moves of the following form: you point to any k of the cards. The wizard then turns those cards face up. If any two of the cards match,the game is over and you win.Otherwise, you must look away, while the wizard arbitrarily permutes the k chosen cards and then turns them back face-down. Then,it is your turn again.\nWe say this game is winnable if there exist some positive integer m and some strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most m moves,no matter how the wizard responds.

Indeed, by taking the difference of the ith and $(i+1)\\mathrm{s t}$ query, we can deduce the value of the ith card, for $1\\leq i\\leq2n-k$ . (This is possible because the cards are flipped face up before they are re-shuffled, so even if two adjacent queries return the same set, one can still determine the ith card. It is possible to solve the problem even without the flipped information, though.) If $k\\leq n$ ,this is more than n cards, so we can find a matching pair.\nFor $k=n$ we remark the following: at each turn after the first, assuming one has not won, there are n cards representing each of the n values exactly once, such that the player has no information about the order of those n cards. We claim that consequently the player cannot guarantee victory. Indeed, let S denote this set of n cards, and S the other n cards. The player will never win by picking only cards in S or S. Also, if the player selects some cards in S and some cards in $\\overline{{S}}$ , then it is possible that the choice of cards in S is exactly the complement of those selected from ${\\overline{{S}}}\\mathrm{:}$ the strategy cannot prevent this since the player has no information on S.

Equality is achieved at $f(n)=\\operatorname*{m a x}(s-n,0)$ and $g(n)=\\operatorname*{m a x}(k s-n,0)$ 1. To prove $$g(n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{k})\\leq f(n_{1})+\\cdots+f(n_{k}),$$ write it as $$\\operatorname*{m a x}(x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{k},0)\\leq\\operatorname*{m a x}(x_{1},0)+\\cdots+\\operatorname*{m a x}(x_{k},0)$$ with $x_{i}=s-n_{i}$ . This can be proven from the $k=2$ case and induction. It remains to show the upper bound. For this problem, define a partition to be a nonincreasing function $p\\colon\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq0}\to\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq0}$ such that $p(n)=0$ for some n. The sum of p is defined to be $\textstyle\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}p(n)$ , which is finite under the previous assumption. Let $L=\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq0}^{2}$ The Young diagram of the partition is the set of points $$\\mathcal{P}:=\\{(x,y)\\in L:y<p(x)\\}.$$ The number of points in P is equal to the sum of p. The conjugate of a partition defined as $$p_{*}(n)={\\mathrm{t h e~n u m b e r~o f~}}i{\\mathrm{~f o r~w h i c h~}}p(i)>n.$$ This is a partition with the same sum as p. Geometrically, the Young diagrams of p and $p_{*}$ are reflections about $x=y$ Since each $g(n)$ is independent, we may maximize each one separately for all n and assume that $$g(n)=\\operatorname*{m i n}_{n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{k}=n}(f(n_{1})+\\cdots+f(n_{k})).$$ The conditions of the problem statement imply that $f{\bigl(}{\textstyle{\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}}{\bigr)}=0$ . Then, for any $\begin{array}{r}{n\\leq k\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}\\end{array}$ , there exists an optimal combination $(n_{1},\\ldots,n_{k})$ in (*) where all $n_{i}$ are at most $\\scriptstyle{\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}$ ,by replacing any term in an optimum greater than $\textstyle{\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}{\\mathrm{~b y~}}{\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}$ and shifting the excess to smaller terms (because $f$ is nonincreasing). Therefore we may extend f to a partition by letting $\begin{array}{r}{f(n)=0\\mathrm{~f o r~}n>\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}\\end{array}$ without affecting the relevant values of g. Then (*) implies that g is a partition as well. The problem can be restated as follows: f is a partition with sum $\\scriptstyle{\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}$ ,and g is a partition defined by $\\left(^{*}\right)$ . Find the maximum possible sum of $g$ . The key claim is that the problem is the same under conjugation. Claim— Under these conditions, we have $$g_{*}(n)=\\operatorname*{m i n}_{n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{k}=n}(f_{*}(n_{1})+\\cdots+f_{*}(n_{k})).$$ Proof. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ and G be the Young diagrams of f and g respectively, and $\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}=L\\setminus\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\overline{{\\mathcal{G}}}=L\\setminus$ be their complements. The lower boundary of $\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}$ is formed by the points $(n,f(n))$ for $i\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq0}$ 1. By the definition of $g$ , the lower boundary of $\\overline{{\\mathcal{G}}}$ consists of points $(n,g(n))$ which are formed by adding k points of $\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}$ . This means $$\\overline{{\\mathcal{G}}}=\\underbrace{\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}+\\cdots+\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{k\\overline{{\\mathcal{F}}}\\mathrm{{'s}}}$$ where + denotes set addition. This definition remains invariant under reflection about $x=y$ ,which swaps f and g with their conjugates. Let A be the sum of g. We now derive different bounds on A. First, by Hermite's identity $$\textstyle n=\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\left\\lfloor{\frac{n+i}{k}}\right\rfloor $$ we have $$\begin{aligned}A&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}g(n)\\&\\leq\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}f\\left(\\left\\lfloor\frac{n+i}{k}\right\rfloor\right)\\&=k^2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}f(n)-\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f(0)\\&=k^2\frac{s(s+1)}{2}-\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f(0).\\end{aligned}$$ By the claim, we also get the second bound $\begin{array}{r}{A\\leq k^{2}\frac{s(s+1)}{2}-\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f_{*}(0)}\\end{array}$ For the third bound, note that $f(f_{*}(0))=0$ and thus $g(k f_{*}(0))=0$ . Moreover, $$g(q f_{*}(0)+r)\\leq q\\cdot f(f_{*}(0))+(k-q-1)f(0)+f(r)=(k-q-1)f(0)+f(r),$$ so we have $$\begin{align*}A&=\\sum_{\\substack{0\\leq q<k\\ 0\\leq r<f_*(0)}}g(q f_*(0)+r)\\&\\leq\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f_*(0)f(0)+k\\sum_{0\\leq r<f_*(0)}f(r)\\&=\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f_*(0)f(0)+k\frac{s(s+1)}{2}.\\end{align*}$$ Now we have thre cases: • If $f(0)\\geq s$ then $$A\\leq k^{2}\frac{s(s+1)}{2}-\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f(0)\\leq\frac{k s(k s+1)}{2}.$$ • If $f_{*}(0)\\geq s$ then $$A\\leq k^{2}\frac{s(s+1)}{2}-\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f_{*}(0)\\leq\frac{k s(k s+1)}{2}.$$ • Otherwise,$f(0)f_{*}(0)\\leq s^{2}$ and $$A\\leq\frac{k(k-1)}{2}f_{*}(0)f(0)+k\frac{s(s+1)}{2}\\leq\frac{k s(k s+1)}{2}.$$ In all cases,$\begin{array}{r}{A\\leq\frac{k s(k s+1)}{2}}\\end{array}$ , as desired. Remark. One can estimate the answer to be around $\begin{array}{r}{k^{2}\frac{s(s+1)}{2}}\\end{array}$ by observing the set addition operation \"dilates\" F by a factor of $k.$ but significant care is needed to sharpen the bound.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "The answer is 985. WLOG, by shifting $a_{1}=0$ (clearly ci $a_{1}$ isn't forced). Now, we construct regular sequences inductively using the following procedure. Start with the inequality \n\n$$\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{0}{1}\\leq x<\\frac{1}{1}.}\\end{array}$$\n\nThen for each $k=2,3,\\ldots,1000$ we perform the following procedure. If there is no fraction of the form $\\begin{array}{r}{F=\\frac{m}{k}}\\end{array}$ in the interval $A\\leq x<B$ ,then $a_{k}$ is forced, and the interval of possible x values does not change. Otherwise,$a_{k}$ is not forced, and we pick a value of $a_{k}$ and update the interval accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe theory of Farey sequences tells us that when we have a stage $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{a}{b}\\leq x<\\frac{c}{d}}\\end{array}$ then the next time we will find a fraction in that interval is exactly $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{a+c}{b+d}}$ (at time $k=b+d)$ ,and it will be the only such fraction.\n\n\n\nSo essentially, starting with $\\textstyle{\\frac{0}{1}}\\leq x<{\\frac{1}{1}}$ we repeatedly replace one of the endpoints of the intervals with the mediant, until one of the denominators exceeds 1000; we are trying to minimize the number of non-forced terms, which is the number of denominators that appear in this process. It is not hard to see that this optimum occurs by always replacing the smaller of the denominators, so that the sequence is \n\n$$\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\frac{0}{1}\\leq x<\\frac{1}{1}}\\ &{\\frac{0}{1}\\leq x<\\frac{1}{2}}\\ &{\\frac{1}{3}\\leq x<\\frac{1}{2}}\\ &{\\frac{1}{3}\\leq x<\\frac{2}{5}}\\ &{\\frac{3}{8}\\leq x<\\frac{2}{5}}\\ &{\\frac{3}{8}\\leq x<\\frac{5}{13}}\\end{array}$$\n\nand so on; we see that the non-forced terms in this optimal configuration are exactly the Fibonacci numbers. There are 15 Fibonacci numbers less than 1000, hence the answer \n\n$1000-15=985$",

      "text": "A particle experiencing a central force has a potential energy $V(r)$ which only depends on its radial coordinate, and conserved angular momentum $$L=|\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}|=m r^{2}{\\dot{\\theta}}.$$ Its kinetic energy can thus be written in terms of the radial velocity $\\dot{r}$ and $L.$ $$E=\\frac{1}{2}m v_{r}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\theta}^{2}+V(r)=\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^{2}+\\left(V(r)+\\frac{L^{2}}{2m r^{2}}\\right).$$ By setting the time derivative of this expression to zero, we find $$m\\ddot{r}=-\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(V(r)+\\frac{L^{2}}{2m r^{2}}\\right).$$ Therefore, if we are interested in $r(t)$ alone,we can find it by treating theproblemas one-dimensional, where the particle moves in the \"effective potential\"$V(r)+L^{2}/2m r^{2}$ The extra term is called the angular momentum barrier and repels the particle away from the center. Once we know $r(t)$ we can find $\\theta(t)$ if desired by using $\\dot{\\theta}=L/m r^{2}$ One way of understanding the effective potential term is to think in terms of the energy methods of M4. From the perspective of $r(t)$ alone, any dependence on $\\dot{r}^{2}$ is part of the kinetic energy, and any dependence onr is part of the potential energy. In particular, the kinetic energy of tangential motion depends only on r, because it is fixed by angular momentum conservation, so it appears as part of the potential when considering only radial motion. In general relativity, the gravitational potential around a black hole of mass M is $$V(r)=-\\frac{G M m}{r}-\\frac{G M L^{2}}{m c^{2}r^{3}}.$$ The second term is a relativistic effect which strengthens the attraction towards the black hole. (It has nothing to do with the angular momentum barrier; you still have to add that separately.). Find the closest possible approach radius of an unbound object. That is, among the set of all trajectories that start and end far away from the black hole (i.e. without falling into it), find the smallest possible minimum value of r. For all parts, assume the particle is moving nonrelativistically.",

      "text": "For this to happen, the effective potential needs a maximum, so the particle can \"bounce\" off it and get back to $r\\to\\infty$ . Thus we need $L>\\sqrt{12}G M m/c$ . For each value of L, the closest we can get while still bouncing off corresponds to the lower critical value of $V_{\\mathrm{e f f}}(r)$ 1, which was shown in part (b) to be $$r_{\\mathrm{m i n}}(L)=\\frac{L^{2}-\\sqrt{L^{4}-12(G M m L/c)^{2}}}{2G M m^{2}}.$$ This function is minimized when $L\\to\\infty$ (i.e. when the particle is launched from a very large impact parameter), so the closest possible approach radius is $$\\operatorname*{l i m}_{L\\to\\infty}r_{\\mathrm{m i n}}(L)={\\frac{6(G M m/c)^{2}}{2G M m^{2}}}={\\frac{3G M}{c^{2}}}$$ where we used the binomial theorem in the first step. (Again, you could get slightly closer, but you would necessarily have to fire a rocket to make it back out.) By the way, the shapes of the orbits in this potential can be quite exciting, featuring \"zoom-whirl\"patterns where a particle slowly \"zooms\" around a black hole, then falls inward and quickly \"whirls\"around it several times, then comes back out. Such orbits produce interesting gravitational wave signatures. You can find a numeric simulation of them here.",

Call a cell good if it satisfies the condition of the problem.\n\n\n\n Coloring proof, from the author. We now prove that no more than $(n-1)^{2}$ squares can be good. The cells are weakly ordered $ by\\geq(there$ : may be some ties due to equal elements); we arbitrarily extend it to a total ordering >, breaking all ties.(Alternatively one can phrase this as perturbing the grid entries in such a way that they become distinct.)\n\n\\bullet For every column, we color red the >-smallest element in that column.\n\n\\bullet For every row, we color blue the >-largest element in that row.\n\nThis means that there are exactly n red and n blue cells. Note that these cells are never good.\n\n\n\nClaim— There is at most one cell that is both red and blue.\n\nProof. Assume for contradiction that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are two \"purple\" cells (both red and blue). Look at the resulting picture \n\n$$\\left[\\begin{matrix}{P_{1}}&{x}\\\\ {y}&{P_{2}}\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right].$$\n\nBy construction, we have $P_{1}\\gtrdot x\\gtrdot P_{2}\\gtrdot y\\gtrdot P_{1}$ . This is a contradiction.\n\nThus at least $2n-1$ cells cannot be good. This proves the bound.\n\n Proof using Konig's theorem, from Ankan Bhattacharya. This proof is based on the following additional claim:\n\nClaim— No column/row can be all-good, and no transversal can be all-good.\n\nProof. The first part is obvious. As for the second, let $r_{i}$ and $c_{j}$ denote the column sums.If cell $(i,j)$ is good, then \n\n$$r_{i}<a_{i,j}<c_{j}.$$\n\nIf we have a good transversal, summing the inequality $r_{i}<c_{j}$ over the cells in this transversal gives a contradiction (as $\\textstyle\\sum r_{\\bullet}=\\sum c_{\\bullet})$ 1.□\n\nThis claim alone is enough to imply the desired bound.\n\nClaim— There exists a choice of a columns and b rows, with $a+b=n+1$ ., such that no good cells lie on the intersection of the columns and rows.\n\nProof. Follows by Knig's theorem, and the previous claim. Alternatively, quote the contrapositive of Hall's marriage theorem: because there was no all-good transversal,there must be a set of a columns with more than $n-a``compatible$ rows.□Suppose $\\begin{array}{r}{a\\leq\\frac{n}{2}\\leq b;}\\end{array}$ ; the other case is similar. Now we bound:\n\n\\bullet The $a\\times b$ cells of the claim are given to be all non-good.\n\n\\bullet In the $n-a=b-1$ remaining rows, there is at least one more non-good cell.\n\nThus the number of non-good cells is at least \n\n$$ab+(b-1)=(a+1)b-1\\ge2\\cdot n-1=n^{2}-(n-1)^{2},$$\n\nand so there are at most $(n-1)^{2}$ ,good cells.",

Abbreviate $[n]:=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ , and WLOG assume $\\textstyle\\sum x_{i}=1$ . To prove the bound, we first rewrite the left-hand side using indicator functions and switch the order of summation as \n\n\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\\mathrm{LHS}&=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{x_i}{|A_i|}\\frac{x_j}{|A_j|}|A_i\\cap A_j|^2\\\\&=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{x_i}{|A_i|}\\frac{x_j}{|A_j|}\\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]}\\sum_{q\\in[n]}\\mathbf{1}_{p\\in A_i}\\mathbf{1}_{q\\in A_j}\\right)\\\\&=\\sum_{p\\in[n]}\\sum_{q\\in[n]}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{x_i\\mathbf{1}_{p\\in A_i}}{|A_i|}\\cdot\\frac{x_j\\mathbf{1}_{q\\in A_j}}{|A_j|}.\\end{align*}$$ \n\nHence, if we define the $n^{2}$ variables \n\n$$v_{p,q}:=\\sum_{i:p,q\\in A_{i}}{\\frac{x_{i}}{|A_{i}|}}.$$\n\nfor each $(p,q)\\in[n]^{2}$ then the previous expression simplifies to just \n\n$$\\mathrm{L H S}=\\sum_{p\\in[n]}\\sum_{q\\in[n]}v_{p,q}^{2}.$$ \n\ncProof of bound. We split the sum into $p=q$ versus $p\\neq q$ and bound by QM-AM separately in the obvious way. For the terms $p=q$ \n\n\n\n$$\\sum_{p\\in[n]}v_{p,p}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left|A_i\\right|\\cdot\\frac{x_i}{\\left|A_i\\right|}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i=1$$\n\n$$\\implies\\sum_{p\\in[n]}v_{p,p}^{2}\\geq\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\in[n]}v_{p,p}\\right)^{2}}{n}=\\frac{1}{n}.$$\n\nWhen $p\\neq q$ we instead have \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{\\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]}v_{p,q}}&{{}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}2\\binom{|A_{i}|}{2}\\cdot\\frac{x_{i}}{|A_{i}|}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(|A_{i}|-1)x_{i}\\geq\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(\\ell-1)x_{i}=\\ell-1}\\\\ {\\implies\\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]}v_{p,q}^{2}}&{{}\\geq\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{p\\neq q\\in[n]}v_{p,q}\\right)^{2}}{n(n-1)}\\geq\\frac{(\\ell-1)^{2}}{n(n-1)}.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nCombining the two bounds gives \n\n$$\\mathrm{L H S}\\geq{\\frac{1}{n}}+{\\frac{(\\ell-1)^{2}}{n(n-1)}}={\\frac{n+\\ell^{2}-2\\ell}{n(n-1)}}$$\n\nwhich matches the answer claimed above.\n\n( Construction. Equality occurs if $v_{p,p}$ is the same for all p and $v_{p,q}$ is the same for all $p\\neq q$ , and $|A_{i}|=\\ell$ 'for all i. This occurs if one takes, say,$k={\\binom{n}{\\ell}}$ and $A_{i}$ to be all the subsets of size l each exactly once.\n\n\n\nRemark. Originally, the write-up I used considered vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$ where entries will be indexed by ordered pairs $(p,q)\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}^{2}$ . It was equivalent to the solution above, but looking back, I think this makes the problem look harder than it actually is.\n\nFor comparison, here is how the notation with vectors works, using $\\langle\\bullet,\\bullet\\rangle$ for dot product,and $\\left\\|\\bullet\\right\\|$ for the vector norm. For $i=1,\\ldots,n$ define $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ by \n\n\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{i}[p,q]\\mathrel{\\mathop:}=\\begin{cases}{\\frac{1}{|A_{i}|}}&{p\\in A_{i}{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}q\\in A_{i}}\\\\ {0}&{\\operatorname{o t h e r w i s e};}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\qquad\\mathbf{v}\\mathrel{\\mathop:}=\\sum_{i}x_{i}\\mathbf{v}_{i}.$$\n\nThen \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}x_{i}x_{j}\\frac{|A_{i}\\cap A_{j}|^{2}}{|A_{i}||A_{j}|}}&{{}=\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}x_{i}x_{j}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{v}_{i},\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\right\\rangle}\\\\ {}&{{}=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\|\\mathbf{v}\\right\\|^{2}.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nDefine two more vectors e and $^{1;}$ the vector e has 1 in the $(p,q)^{\\mathrm{t h}}$ component if $p=q$ , and 0 otherwise, while 1 has all-ones. In that case, note that \n\n\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{\\left\\langle\\mathbf{e},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle}&{{}=\\sum_{i}x_{i}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{e},\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{i}x_{i}}\\\\ {\\left\\langle\\mathbf{1},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle}&{{}=\\sum_{i}x_{i}\\left\\langle\\mathbf{1},\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{i}x_{i}|A_{i}|.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nThat means for any positive real constants \\alpha and $\\beta$ , by Cauchy-Schwarz for vectors, we should have \n\n\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{\\left\\|\\alpha\\mathbf{e}+\\beta\\mathbf{1}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{v}\\right\\|}&{{}\\geq\\left\\langle\\alpha\\mathbf{e}+\\beta\\mathbf{1},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle=\\alpha\\left\\langle\\mathbf{e},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle+\\beta\\left\\langle\\mathbf{1},\\mathbf{v}\\right\\rangle}\\\\ {}&{{}=\\alpha\\cdot\\sum x_{i}+\\beta\\cdot\\sum x_{i}|A_{i}|\\geq(\\alpha+\\ell\\beta)\\sum x_{i}.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSet $\\mathbf{w}\\mathrel{\\mathop:}=\\alpha\\mathbf{e}+\\beta\\mathbf{1}$ for brevity. Then \n\n$$\\mathbf{w}[p,q]=\\begin{cases}{\\alpha+\\beta}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p=q}\\\\ {\\beta}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p\\neq q}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\implies\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|=\\sqrt{n\\cdot(\\alpha+\\beta)^{2}+(n^{2}-n)\\cdot\\beta^{2}}.$$\n\nTherefore, we get an lower bound \n\n$$\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}{\\sum x_{i}}\\geq\\frac{\\alpha+\\ell\\beta}{\\sqrt{n\\cdot(\\alpha+\\beta)^{2}+(n^{2}-n)\\cdot\\beta^{2}}}$$\n\nLetting $\\alpha=n-\\ell$ and $\\beta=\\ell-1$ gives a proof that the constant \n\n$$c=\\frac{((n-\\ell)+\\ell(\\ell-1))^{2}}{n\\cdot(n-1)^{2}+(n^{2}-n)\\cdot(\\ell-1)^{2}}=\\frac{(n+\\ell^{2}-2\\ell)^{2}}{n(n-1)\\left(n+\\ell^{2}-2\\ell\\right)}=\\frac{n+\\ell^{2}-2\\ell}{n(n-1)}$$\n\nmakes the original inequality always true. (The choice of $\\alpha:\\beta$ is suggested by the example below.)\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, for the construction (where $k={\\binom{n}{\\ell}},\\mathrm{e t c.})$ it would be suffi icient to show that w and v are scalar multiples, so that the above Cauchy-Schwarz is equality. However, we can compute \n\n\n\n$$\\mathbf{w}[p,q]=\\begin{cases}{n-1}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p=q}\\\\ {\\ell-1}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p\\neq q}\\\\ \\end{cases},\\qquad\\mathbf{v}[p,q]=\\begin{cases}{\\binom{n-1}{\\ell-1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\ell}}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p=q}\\\\ {\\binom{n-2}{\\ell-2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\ell}}&{\\mathrm{i f~}p\\neq q}\\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\nwhich are indeed scalar multiples.",

But $p^{\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{2}}\\mid2^{p-1}-1$ . means p is odd, so working in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ , we have \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{(x-1)f(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\\frac{1}{p}\\binom{p}{k}(-1)^{k-1}x^{p^{n-1}k}}&{{}=\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\\binom{p-1}{k-1}(-1)^{k-1}\\frac{x^{p^{n-1}k}}{k}}\\\\ {}&{{}=\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\\frac{x^{p^{n-1}k}}{k^{p^{n-1}}}=F(x)^{p^{n-1}},}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere we use Fermat's little theorem,${\\textstyle{\\binom{p-1}{k-1}}\\equiv(-1)^{k-1}}$ (mod p) for $k=1,2,\\ldots,p-1$ , and the well-known fact that $P(x^{p})-P(x)^{p}$ has all coefficients divisible by p for any polynomiall $P$ with integer coeffi cients.However, it is easy to verify that $p^{2}\\mid2^{p-1}-1$ if and only if $p\\;\\mid\\;F(-1)$ ,i.e. −1 is a root of F in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ Furthermore,$\\textstyle F^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{x^{p-1}-1}{x-1}=(x+1)(x+2)\\cdots(x+p-2)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p},\\mathrm{s o}~{-1}$ is a root of F with multiplicity 2;hence $N\\geq2p^{n-1}$ .On the other hand, since $F^{\\prime}$ 1has no double roots, F has no integer roots with multiplicity greater than 2. In particular,$N\\leq2p^{n-1}$ (note that the multiplicity of 1 is in fact $p^{n-1}-1$ , since $F(1)=0$ by Wolstenholme's theorem but 1 is not a root of $\\left|F^{\\prime}\\right)$ \n\nRemark. The rth derivative of a polynomial P evaluated at 1 is simply the coeficient $[(x-1)^{r}]P$ (i.e. the coeff  cient of $(x-1)^{r}$ when P is written as a polynomial in $x-1)$ divided by r!.\n\nSolution 2. This is asking to find the greatest multiplicity of an integer root of f modulo $p;$ I claim the answer is $2p^{n-1}$ \n\nFirst, we shift x by 1 and take the negative (since this doesn't change the greatest multiplicity) for convenience, redefining f as $\\begin{array}{r}{f(x)=\\frac{(x+1)^{p^{n}}-x^{p^{n}}-1}{p x}}\\\\ \\end{array}$ \n\nNow, we expand this. We can show, by writing out and cancelling, that $p^{1}$ fully divides ${\\binom{p^{n}}{k}}$ only when $p^{n-1}$ divides $k;$ thus, we can ignore all terms except the ones with degree divisible by.$p^{n-1}$ (since they still go away when taking it mod $p)$ , leaving $f(x)=\\frac{1}{p x}(\\binom{p^{n}}{p^{n-1}}x^{p^{n}-p^{n-1}}+\\cdots+\\binom{p^{n}}{p^{n}-p^{n-1}}x^{p^{n-1}})$ \n\nWe can also show, by writing out/cancelling, that ${\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{p}}{\\binom{p^{n}}{k p^{n-1}}}}={\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{p}}{\\binom{p}{k}}}$ modulo p. Simplifying using this, the expression above becomes $f(x)=\\frac{1}{px}(\\binom{p}{1}x^{p^{n}-p^{n-1}}+\\cdots+\\binom{p}{p-1}x^{p^{n-1}})=\\frac{1}{px}((x^{p^{n-1}}+1)^{p}-(x^{p^{n}}+1))$ \n\nNow, we ignore the $1/x$ for the moment (all it does is reduce the multiplicity of the root at $x=0{\\mathrm{~b y~}}1)$ )and \n\njust look at the rest,$P(x)=\\textstyle\\frac{1}{p}((x^{p^{n-1}}+1)^{p}-(x^{p^{n}}+1))$ \n\n5\n\nSubstituting $y=x^{p^{n-1}}$ ,this becomes $\\textstyle\\frac{1}{p}((y+1)^{p}-(y^{p}+1))$ ; since ${\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{p}}}{\\binom{p}{k}}={\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{k}}}{\\binom{p-1}{k-1}}$ ,this is equal to $P(x)=$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{1}{1}\\binom{p-1}{0}y^{p-1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{p-1}\\binom{p-1}{p-2}y}\\\\ \\end{array}$ . (We work mod p now; the ps can be cancelled before modding out.)\n\nWe now show that $P(x)$ has no integer roots of multiplicity greater than 2, by considering the root multiplicities of y times its reversal, or $\\bar{Q(x)}=\\frac{1}{p-1}\\binom{p-1}{p-2}y^{p-1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{1}\\binom{p-1}{0}y$ 1.\n\nNote that some polynomial P has a root of multiplicity m at x iff P and its first $m-1$ derivatives all have zeroes at x. (We're using the formal derivatives here - we can prove this algebraically over $\\mathbb{Z}$ mod $p$ ,if $m<p.)$ !The derivative of Q is $\\binom{p-1}{p-2}y^{p-2}+\\cdots+\\binom{p-1}{0},\\mathrm{or}(y+1)^{p-1}-y^{p-1}$ , which has as a root every residue except $0{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}{-1}$ by Fermat's little theorem; the second derivative is a constant multiple of $(y+1)^{p-2}-y^{p-2}$ which has no integer roots by Fermat's little theorem and unique inverses. Therefore, no integer root of $Q$ has multiplicity greater than 2; we know that the factorization of a polynomial's reverse is just the reverse of its factorization, and integers have inverses mod $p,$ , SO $P(x)$ doesn't have integer roots of multiplicity greater than 2 either.\n\nFactoring $P(x)$ completely in y (over some extension of $\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ , we know that two distinct factors can't share a root; thus, at most 2 factors have any given integer root, and since their degrees (in x) are each root; thus, at most 2 factors have any given integer root, and since their degrees (in x) are each $p^{n-1}$ ,this means no integer root has multiplicity greater than $2p^{n-1}$ \n\nHowever, we see that $y=1$ is a double root of P. This is because plugging in gives $P(1)=\\frac{1}{p}((1+1)^{p}-$ $\\textstyle(1^{p}+1))=\\frac{1}{p}(2^{p}-2)$ ; by the condition,$p^{2}$ divides $2^{p}-2$ , so this is zero mod p. Since 1 is its own inverse,it's a root of $Q$ as well, and it's a root of $Q^{\\mathrm{{'s}}}$ derivative so it's a double root (so $(y-1)^{2}$ is part of $Q^{\\mathrm{{'s}}}$ \\未factorization). Reversing,$(y-1)^{2}$ ,is part of $P\\mathrm{^{\\prime}s}$ factorization as well.\n\nApplying a well-known fact,$y-1=x^{p^{n-1}}-1=(x-1)^{p^{n-1}}$ modulo $p,$ so 1 is a root of P with multiplicity \n\n$2p^{n-1}$ \n\nSince adding back in the factor of $1/x$ doesn't change this multiplicity, our answer is therefore $2p^{n-1}$ \n\nThis second solution was suggested by Alex Smith.",

On the other hand, every blue edge is incident to at least two more blue edges, so no connected component can have fewer than three edges. As the connected components are bipartite, it follows each connected component has at least four vertices, which is impossible.\n\n Brute force (mine).

      "images": []
    },
    "answer": {
      "text": "We color the grid with $ ``colors0,1,2,3,4$ . To define the coloring, we coordinatize the grid so that one side is the y-axis, a side that joins it is the x-axis, and that corner is the origin. Let the point $(n,m)$ indicate the square in the grid given by coordinates $(n,m),(n,m+$ 1)$,(n+1,m),(n+1,m+1)$ 1. Consider the coloring $f(n,m)\\equiv n-m$ mod 5. Clearly, any 5consecutive squares in the vertical or horizontal directions are colored in the 5 distinct colors.Thus, any $1\\times5$ tile covers each color exactly once. This means that, if a coloring exists, all colors appear 115 times except for one which appears 116 times; and the single square must color this last color. The function colors the main diagonal (which goes through the origin) of the grid with 0, and the colors 2,3 and 1,4 flip across the diagonal; then the number of squares colored 1,2,3,4 must be all equal and 0 is the odd one out. Thus, the single square must lie on a coordinates $(m,n)$ such that $m-n\\equiv0$ mod 5. Next, we rotate the coloring; we could write it as the function given by $g(m,n)\\;\\equiv\\;m+n$ mod 5. In this case, the other main diagonal is a solid color, and that color is the one with most squares. We know that (0,23) is on this diagonal, so the relevant color is 3. This means that the single sguare must lie on some coordinate $(m,n)$ such that $m+n\\equiv3$ mod 5. Combined with the previous restriction on $(m,n)$ we get $2m\\;\\equiv\\;3$ mod $5\\;\\Rightarrow\\;m\\;\\equiv\\;4$ mod 5 and this implies that $n\\equiv4$ mod 5. Thus, there are currently $4\\cdot4=16$ candidates for the position of the single square, because m,$n\\equiv4$ mod 5 and $0\\leq m,n\\leq23$ .We check that all these positions allow for a covering of the grid. By symmetry, there are only three cases to check;$(m,n)=(4,4);(9,4);(9,9)$ 1. In each case, we use $161\\times5$ tiles to form a $9\\times9$ square with the single square at its center. In each position case, punching out the $9\\times9$ square leaves the $24\\times24$ grid in a state that can be separated into several large rectangular subgrids each of which has one dimension divisible by 5. Specifically,$24-9=15$ so the (4,4) case leaves us with $9\\times15$ ,$15\\times9{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}15\\times15$ subgrids to cover. The $(9,4)$ case leaves us with $5\\times24,9\\times15$ and $10\\times24$ —4subgrids. The (9, 9) case leaves us with $5\\times24,5\\times10,5\\times5$ ,and $10\\times24\\mathrm{s u b g r i d s}$ . Thus, all 16 potential positions allow for a full covering of the $24\\times24$ :grid by symmetry, giving us the answer of $\\boxed{16}$",

    "answer": {
      "text": "All P of the form $P(x)=c x^{k}$ ,where c is a nonzero integer and k is a nonnegative integer. Suppose $P(x)=x^{k}Q(x)$ with $Q(0)\neq0$ and Q is nonconstant; then there exist infinitely many primes p dividing some $Q{\big(}n{\big)}$ ; fix one of them not dividing $Q(0)$ ,and take a sequence of pairwise coprime integers $m_{1},n_{1},m_{2},n_{2}$ , . .. with $p\\mid Q(m_{i}),Q(n_{i})$ (we can do this with CRT). Let $f(x,y,z)$ be the number written at $(x,y,z)$ . Note that $P(m)$ divides every $m n\times m n\times m$ grid and $P(n)$ divides every mn $\times m n\times n$ grid, so by Bezout's identity,$(P(m),P(n))$ divides every mn X $m n\times(m,n)$ grid. It follows that p divides every $m_{i}n_{i}\times m_{i}n_{i}\times1$ grid. Similarly, we find that p divides every $m_{i}n_{i}m_{j}n_{j}{\times}1{\times}1$ grid whenever $i\neq j$ , and finally, every $1\times1\times1{\\mathrm{~g r i d}}$ Since p was arbitrarily chosen from an infinite set,$f$ must be identically zero, contradiction.For the other direction, take a solution g to the one-dimensional case using repeated CRT (the key relation gcd $(P(m),P(n))=P(\\operatorname*{g c d}(m,n))$ prevents $ ``conflicts'')$ :start with a positive multiple of $P(1)\neq0$ at zero, and then construct $g(1),g(-1),g(2),g(-2)$ 1, etc. in that order using CRT. Now for the three-dimensional version, we can just let $f(x,y,z)=g(x)$ The crux of the problem lies in the 1D case. (We use the same type of reasoning to $ ``project$ 'from d dimension to $d-1$ .dimensions.) Note that the condition $P(n)\\mid g(i)+\\cdots+$ $g(i+n-1)$ (for the 1D case) is \"almost” the same as $P(n)\\mid g(i)-g(i+n)$ , so we immediately find gcd $(P(m),P(n))\\mid g(i)-g(i+\\operatorname*{g c d}(m,n))$ by Bezout's identity. In particular, when m, n are coprime, we will intuitively be able to get gcd $(P(m),P(n))$ Ias large as we want unless $P$ is of the form $c x^{k}$ (we formalize this by writing $P=x^{k}Q{\\mathrm{~w i t h~}}Q(0)\neq0)$ Conversely, if $P=c x^{k}$ ,then g $\\operatorname*{g c d}(P(m),P(n))=P(\\operatorname*{g c d}(m,n))$ renders our derived restriction gcd $(P(m),P(n))|g(i)-g(i+\\operatorname*{g c d}(m,n))$ Isuperfluous. So it \"feels $\\mathrm{e a s y}$ to find nonconstant g with $P(n)|g(i)-g(i+n)$ for all $i,n.$ just by greedily constructing $g(0),g(1),g(-1),\\ldots$ . in that order using CRT. Fortunately,$g(i)+\\cdots+g(i+m-1)-g(i)-\\cdots-g(i+n-1)=$ $g(i+n)+\\cdots+g(i+n+(m-n)-1)$ for $m>n$ , so the inductive approach still works for the stronger condition $P(n)\\mid g(i)+\\cdots+g(i+n-1)$ Note that polynomial constructions cannot work for $P~=~c x^{d+1}$ in d dimensions. Suppose otherwise, and take a minimal dgree $f(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d});$ ;then f isn't constant,SO $f^{\\prime}(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d}){=}f(x_{1}+1,\\ldots,x_{d}+1)-f(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{d})$ is a working polynomial of strictly smaller degree.",

Exchange: If he has at least 3 red beads in his bowl, then he may exchange 3 red beads for 2 green beads. 2. Swap: He may replace each green bead in his bowl with a red bead and replace each red bead in his bowl with a green bead. That is, if he starts with i red beads and j green beads, then after he performs this operation, he will have j red beads and i green beads. A monk may leave the Temple of Forever only when he has exactly 5 red beads and 5 green beads in his bowl. Inside the Temple of Forever, the Gong of Time rings on. As you may well imagine,the monks begin to recognize that no matter how many ways they try to exchange or swap their beads, they always seem to end up in some state they've already been in before! For one or two monks, this realization is all they need to propel them instantly into a state of enlightenment. For the overwhelming majority, however, this knowledge does nothing but weaken their resolve. They just get depressed. Taking note of the mental state of this second group, the Keeper of the Temple makes an unannounced appearance and proclaims to the group, \"From now on, any monk who is able to visit 108 (108 being the mystical number that encompasses all of existence) unique states will be allowed to leave the Temple of Forever.\" Do the monks have any chance of leaving the Temple of Forever?

This is because the path leading to (2, 5) ends at (2, 5), whereas the path leading to (2, 4) continues with swaps and exchanges, with the final state being (2, 0) (arrived at via a swap). However,the monk can reach 52 unique states if, at state (5, 2), he performs two swap in a row to pick up state (2,5). Alternatively, the monk can perform two swaps at the start state,picking up state (12,15), and then continue with 25 pairs of sequential exchange, swap operations until he reaches (2,0).

      "text": "n prime only\n\n Proof for n prime. Suppose $n=p$ . In an arithmetic progression with p terms, it's easy to see that either every term has a different residue modulo p (if the common difference is not a multiple of $p)$ ,or all of the residues coincide (when the common difference is a multiple of p).\n\n\n\nSo, look at the multiples of p in a row-valid table; there is either 1 or p per row. As there are p such numbers total, there are two cases:\n\n• If all the multiples of p are in the same row,then the common difference in each row is a multiple of p. In fact, it must be exactly p for size reasons. In other words,up to permutation the rows are just the k (mod p) numbers in some order, and this is obviously column-valid because we can now permute such that the kth column contains exactly $\\{(k-1)p+1,(k-1)p+2,\\ldots,k p\\}$ \n\n\n\n• If all the multiples of p are in different rows, then it follows each row contains every residue modulo p exactly once. So we can permute to a column-valid arrangement by ensuring the kth column contains all the k (mod p) numbers.\n\n Counterexample for n composite (due to Anton Trygub). Let p be any prime divisor of n. Construct the table as follows:\n\n•Row 1 contains 1 through n.\n\n•Rows 2 through $p+1$ contain the numbers from $p+1{\\mathrm{~t o~}}n p+n$ partitioned into arithmetic progressions with common difference p.\n\n\n\n• The rest of the rows contain the remaining numbers in reading order.\n\nFor example, when.$p=2$ and $n=10$ , we get the following table:\n\n\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>(i: 1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>21</td><td>23</td><td>25</td><td>27</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>32</td><td>33</td><td>34</td><td>35</td><td>36</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>39</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>43</td><td>44</td><td>45</td><td>46</td><td>47</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>52</td><td>53</td><td>54</td><td>55</td><td>56</td><td>57</td><td>58</td><td>59</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>62</td><td>63</td><td>64</td><td>65</td><td>66</td><td>67</td><td>68</td><td>69</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td>72</td><td>73</td><td>74</td><td>75</td><td>76</td><td>77</td><td>78</td><td>79</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>81 91</td><td>82 92</td><td>83 93</td><td>84 94</td><td>85 95</td><td>86 96</td><td>87 97</td><td>88 98</td><td>89 99</td><td>90 100]</td></tr></table>\n\n\nWe claim this works fine. Assume for contradiction the rows may be permuted to obtain a column-valid arrangement. Then the n columns should be arithmetic progressions whose smallest element is in $[1,n]$ and whose largest element is in $[n^{2}-n+1,n^{2}]$ . These two elements must be congruent modulo $n-1$ , so in particular the column containing 2must end with $n^{2}-n+2$ \n\n\n\nHence in that column, the common difference must in fact be exactly n.

As for Y ,note that if $s=s_{1}\\ldots s_{n-1}$ had k ones, then the modified string has $(n-1-k)+1=n-k$\nones, ergo ${\\overline{{s}}}_{n-1}\\dots{\\overline{{s}}}_{1}1\\mapsto{\\overline{{s}}}_{n-1}\\dots{\\overline{{s}}}_{k+1}s_{k}{\\overline{{s}}}_{k-1}\\dots{\\overline{{s}}}_{1}1$ which is what we wanted.

Since 1...1 takes n steps to finish we have\n$$E_{n}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[E_{n-1}+\\left(E_{n-1}+n\\right)\\right]$$\nbased on cases on whether the chosen string is in X or $Y$ or not. By induction, we have $\\begin{array}{r}{E_{n}=\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cdots+n)=\\frac{1}{4}n(n+1)}\\end{array}$ 1, as desired.\nRemark.Actually,the following is true: if the indices of the 1's are $1\\leq i_{1}<\\cdots<i_{\\ell}\\leq n$ then the number of operations required is\n$$2(i_{1}+\\cdots+i_{\\ell})-\\ell^{2}.$$\nThis problem also has an interpretation as a Turing machine: the head starts at a position on the tape (the binary string). If it sees a 1, it changes the cell to a 0 and moves left; if it sees a 0,it changes the cell to a l and moves right.",

We will generate contradictions by providing two primes $p,q\\in\\mathcal{P}$ and assosciated nonconstant functions $f_{p},f_{q}:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ with periods p and q respectively such that $f_{p}(x_{i})=f_{q}(x_{i})$ for all i.\nClaim — There exists a prime $r\\in\\mathcal{P}$ such that for all primes $p\\in\\mathcal{P}\\setminus\\{r\\}$ ,the set of integers $\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$ ·forms a complete residue class modulo p (i.e. for all t, there exists i such that $x_{i}\\equiv t\\pmod{p}$ \nClaim— Suppose for the sake of contradiction that suchr didn't exist, and there were in fact two primes $p,q\\in\\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\{x_{1}\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$ did not form a complete residue class modulo eitherpor q. Concretely, consider t,s such that there is noi with $x_{i}\\equiv t\\pmod{p}$ and not j with $x_{j}\\equiv s$ (mod q).\nConstruct the functions $f_{p},f_{q}:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ as \n$$f_{p}(x)=\\begin{cases}{0}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\not\\equiv t{\\pmod{p}}}\\ {1}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv t{\\pmod{p}}}\\end{cases}$$\nand \n$$f_{q}(x)=\\begin{cases}{0}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\not\\equiv s{\\pmod{q}}}\\ {1}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv s{\\pmod{q}}}\\end{cases}.$$\nWe have $f_{p}(x_{i})=f_{q}(x_{i})=0$ for all i, which is the desired contradiction.\nLet r be the prime from the above claim. Let p, q be the largest two primes in $\\mathcal{P}\\setminus\\{r\\}$ so $n\\leq p+q$ −2. Construct the graph $G_{p q}$ with vertex set $\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$ and edge $x_{i}\\sim x_{j}$ if $p~|~x_{i}-x_{j}~\\mathrm{o r}~q~|~x_{i}-x_{j}$ . The following claim allows us to construct a pair of bad functions $f_{p},f_{q}$ \nClaim — The graph $G_{p q}$ is disconnected.\nProof. Let $G_{p}$ be the graph on vertex set $\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$ with edge $x_{i}\\sim x_{j}{\\mathrm{~i f~}}p\\mid x_{i}-x_{j}$ Note that $G_{p}$ is a collection of p disjoint cliques, one for each residuce class modulo p.\nPrune the graph into $G_{p}^{\\prime}$ ,where each clique $K_{r}$ is replaced by a path of edge-length $r-1$ Define $G_{q}^{\\prime}$ similarly, and let $G_{p q}^{\\prime}$ be the union of $G_{p}^{\\prime}$ and $G_{q}^{\\prime}$ \nNote that $G_{p q}$ and $G_{p q}^{\\prime}$ have the exact same connectivity properties. We have \n$$|E(G_{p q}^{\\prime})|\\leq|E(G_{p}^{\\prime})|+|E(G_{q}^{\\prime})|=(n-p)+(n-q)\\leq n-2,$$\nSO $G_{p q}^{\\prime}$ is disconnected, as desired.\n(□i:\nSuppose $A\\sqcup B=\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$ are sets of disjoint vertices in $G_{p q}$ . Construct the functions $f_{p},f_{q}:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ as \n$$f_{p}(x)=\\begin{cases}{0}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv a{\\pmod{p}}{\\mathrm{~f o r~s o m e~}}a\\in A}\\ {1}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv b{\\pmod{p}}{\\mathrm{~f o r~s o m e~}}b\\in B}\\end{cases}$$\nand \n$$f_{q}(x)=\\begin{cases}{0}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv a{\\pmod{q}}{\\mathrm{~f o r~s o m e~}}a\\in A}\\ {1}&{{\\mathrm{~i f~}}x\\equiv b{\\pmod{q}}{\\mathrm{~f o r~s o m e~}}b\\in B}\\end{cases}.$$\nThese are well defined due to the fact that $p,q\\nmid a-b{\\mathrm{~f o r~}}a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$ ,and the fact that $A\\sqcup B$ forms a complete residue class modulo p. Again, we have $f_{p}(x_{i})=f_{q}(x_{i})$ for all i, which is the desired contradiction.\nConstruction \nLet $n=p_{2}+p_{3}-1$ We claim that Ana has a winning strategy with the selection $x_{i}=p_{1}(i-1)$ ). Indeed, suppose that Banana writes down the values $y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}$ in order.We will show that Ana can always reconstruct p.\n${\\mathsf{C l a i m}}\\mathrm{~—~I f~}y_{1}=\\cdots=y_{n}$ , then Ana can correctly guess $p=p_{1}$ \nProof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $p<p_{1}$ [. Then, since $x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}$ forms a complete residue class modulo $p,f$ must be a constant function, which is the desired contradiction.\nWe can now assume that $y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}$ are not all equal, which means $p\\neq p_{1}$ . Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are two primes $q,r<p_{1}$ with assosciated nonconstant functions $f_{p},f_{q}:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ with periods q and r respectively, such that $f_{q}(x_{i})=f_{r}(x_{i})=y_{i}$ for all i.\nThe following claim shows that $y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n}$ must all be equal, which is the desired contradiction.\n$\\mathsf{C l a i m}\\mathrm{~—~}\\mathrm{L e t}$ G be the graph on vertex set $\\{0,\\ldots,q+r-2\\}$ with edge $i\\sim j$ if $|i-j|\\in\\{q,r\\}$ . The graph G is connected.\nProof. Note that G has $q+r-2$ edges, so it suffices to show that it has no cycles.Suppose for the sake of contradiction it had a cycle $c_{1},\\ldots,c_{k}$ with $k\\geq3$ and indices taken mod k.\nSuppose first that $c_{i+1}-c_{i}=q$ . Then,$c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}$ cannot be $-q$ (else $c_{i}=c_{i+2})$ 1, it cannot be r (else $c_{i+2}>q+r-2)$ , so $c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}\\in\\{q,-r\\}$ \nThe same logic shows the following collated results:\n$$c_{i+1}-c_{i}=q\\implies c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}\\in\\{q,-r\\}$$\n$$\\begin{aligned}{c_{i+1}-c_{i}=-q\\implies c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}}&{{}\\in\\{-q,r\\}}\\ {c_{i+1}-c_{i}=r\\implies c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}}&{{}\\in\\{-q,r\\}}\\ {c_{i+1}-c_{i}=-r\\implies c_{i+2}-c_{i+1}}&{{}\\in\\{q,-r\\}.}\\ \\end{aligned}$$\nThus, either all consecutive differences of vertices in the cycle are in $\\{q,-r\\}$ ,or all in $\\ {-q,r\\}$ . Assume the first case, proof is similar for second case.\nLet a be the number of consecutive differences that are q, and b be the number that $\\mathrm{a r e}-r$ . We see that $a+b=k$ and $q a-r b=0$ .The second condition implies that $a\\geq r$ and $b\\geq q$ _,so we have $k\\geq q+r$ , which is the desired contradiction since G has only $q+r-1$ vertices.",

Because of these requirements any subset of size 4 or more can only be neighbored by sets of size 2 or less, of which there are ${\\binom{7}{1}}+{\\binom{7}{2}}=28$ available. Thus, the chain can contain no more than 29 sets of size 4 or more and no more than 28 sets of size 2 or less. Finally, since there are only $\\textstyle{\\binom{7}{3}}=35$ sets of size 3 available, the total number of sets in such a chain can be at most $2\\hat{9}+28+35=92<100$ , contradiction.\n\n Construction.

This construction yields a chain of length 129 when $S=\\{1,2,\\ldots,8\\}$ \n\nRemark. Here is the construction for $n=8$ in its full glory.\n\n<table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td>345678</td><td>1</td><td>235678</td><td>4</td><td>125678</td><td>3</td><td>145678</td><td>2</td><td>5678</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>15678</td><td>23</td><td>45678</td><td>12</td><td>35678</td><td>14</td><td>678</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>345</td><td>1678</td><td>235</td><td>4678</td><td>125</td><td>3678</td><td>145</td><td>2678</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>34678</td><td>15</td><td>23678</td><td>45</td><td>12678</td><td>35</td><td>78</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3456</td><td>178</td><td>2356</td><td>478</td><td>1256</td><td>378</td><td>1456</td><td>278</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>3478</td><td>156</td><td>2378</td><td>456</td><td>1278</td><td>356</td><td>1478</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>34578</td><td>16</td><td>23578</td><td>46</td><td>12578</td><td>36</td><td>14578</td><td>26</td><td>578</td></tr><tr><td>346</td><td>1578</td><td>236</td><td>4578</td><td>126</td><td>8</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>34567</td><td>18</td><td>23567</td><td>48</td><td>12567</td><td>38</td><td>14567</td><td>28</td><td>567</td></tr><tr><td>348</td><td>1567</td><td>238</td><td>4567</td><td>128</td><td>3567</td><td>148</td><td>67</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3458</td><td>167</td><td>2358</td><td>467</td><td>1258</td><td>367</td><td>1458</td><td>267</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>3467</td><td>158</td><td>2367</td><td>458</td><td>1267</td><td>358</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>34568</td><td>17</td><td>23568</td><td>47</td><td>12568</td><td>37</td><td>14568</td><td>27</td><td>568</td></tr><tr><td>347</td><td>1568</td><td>237</td><td>4568</td><td>127</td><td>3568</td><td>147</td><td>68</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3457</td><td>168</td><td>2357</td><td>468</td><td>1257</td><td>368</td><td>1457</td><td>268</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>3468</td><td>157</td><td>2368</td><td>457</td><td>1268</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Professor Snape has sent Harry to detention and assigned him the task of sorting all the old homework assignments from the last 200 years. Being a wizard, Harry waves his wand and says, ordinatus sortitus, and the papers rapidly pile themselves in order. Professor Snape, however, wants to determine whether Harry's spell correctly sorted the papers.Unfortunately, there are a large number n of papers and determining whether they are in perfect order takes $\\Omega(n)$ time. Professor Snape instead decides to check whether the papers are almost sorted. He wants to know whether 90% of the papers are sorted: is it possible to remove 10% of the papers and have the resulting list be sorted? In this problem, we will help Professor Snape to find an algorithm that takes as input a list A containing n distinct elements, and acts as follows: •If the list A is sorted, the algorithm always returns true. • If the list A is not 90% sorted, the algorithm returns false with probability at least 2/3. Imagine instead that Professor Snape would like to determine whether a list is $1-\\epsilon$ sorted for some $0<\\epsilon<1$ .

The minimum is 2015, since there needs to be a point in J whose xcoordinate is between each two consecutive points in A when sorted by x-coordinate.The minimum is achieved when $A=\\{(t,t)|t=0,1,\\cdots,2015\\}$ For general $|A|=c$ (instead of 2016) the maximum is $2c-2\\sqrt{c}$ To keep things clean, I will let $c=k^{2}$ where k is a positive integer. The construction.as mentioned above is to take a k by k square and rotate it slightly. Now to show that $2c-2k$ suffices, consider the set of points in A as a poset where for points $p,q,p>q$ if p is up and right of q Take the longest antichain and say it has s elements. This antichain is actually an up left chain of points. Partition the remaining points into two sets, those that are > than some element in the antichain and those that are < some element in the antichain.For the first set, Ernie draws points slightly below and left of each point and Ernie draws points slightly above and right of each point in the second set. In total Ernie has drawn $k^{2}-s$ points. (We have eliminated all possible rectangles where the two points in A form an up right vector since these two points cannot both be in the antichain) Now we can do the same for up left rectangles. To finish the problem it suffices to note Dilworth's theorem and use AM-GM. This first solution was suggested by Allen Liu. Solution 2. Here is an alternative way to show the maximum. As above, the number of points needed for J is equal to • Twice the number of points, minus the length of the maximal down-right chain, and minus the length of the maximal up-right chain. If we order the points by their x-coordinate and consider a sequence being their y-coordinates, the two things we are subtracting becomes the length of maximal decreasing subsequence and the length of maximal increasing subsequence respectively.Notice that if the two lengths are m and n respectively, then the number of points is at most mn, because of the famous result that a sequence of $m n+1$ distinct real numbers must either contain an increasing subsequence of length $m+1$ or a decreasing subsequence of length $n+1$ Therefore, in the context of this particular case, we have $m n\\geq2016$ and we need to maximize $2\\cdot2016-m-n$ , and this is easy by AM-GM, and the maximized result is $2\\cdot2016-\\lceil2{\\sqrt{2016}}\rceil=3942$ This maximum is achieved by having a slightly tilted $42\times48$ lattice grid for A.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "Now we're looking for monotone equilibria of the second stage. This problem is almost the problem considered in class with one complication: agents that have decided to attack in the first stage cannot reverse their decision. There are now two situations that can occur in the second stage. Either some agents joint the attack, in which case all agents with private signal below some threshold $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ participate in the attack and the agent with signal $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ is indifferent.$\\mathrm{O r}$ nobody joins the attack, so everybody below $x_{1}^{*}$ participates in the attack but an agent with signal $x_{1}^{*}$ is not indifferent but would rather not attack but cannot reverse his decision. In either case there is a threshold $x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ below which agents participate in the attack. Then the overall size of the attack is given by \n\n$$A(\theta,\tilde{z})=\\Phi\big(\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}\big(x_{p}^{*}(z)-\theta\big)\big).$$\n\nRegime change occurs if and only if \n\n$$\begin{aligned}\theta&\\leq\\Phi(\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}(x_{p}^{*}(z)-\theta))\\\\iff\\Phi^{-1}(\theta)&\\leq\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}(x_{p}^{*}(z)-\theta)\\\\iff\theta+\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}}\\Phi^{-1}(\theta)&\\leq x_{p}^{*}(z)\\\\iff X(\theta)&\\leq x_{p}^{*}(z)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere \n\n$$X(\theta)\\equiv\theta+\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}}\\Phi^{-1}(\theta).$$\n\nThe function X is strictly increassing. Let $\theta_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ be the level of fundamentals at which the inequality above holds with equality, that is $X(\theta_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z}))\\:=\\:x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ . Then regime change occurs if and only if $\theta\\leq\theta_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ . Let's write $\\Theta=X^{-1}$ ,then we can write $\theta_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})=\\Theta(x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z}))$ 1. That is, for a given participation threshold $x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ ,the function Θwill give us the threshold of fundamentals below which regime change occurs.\n\nNow let $H(x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z}),x,\tilde{z})$ be the expected utility from attacking of an agent conditional on having observed a private signal x and a public signal z if all other agents below the participation threshold $x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ participate in the attack.So \n\n$$H\big(x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z}),x,\tilde{z}\big)\\equiv b P[\theta\\leq\\Theta(x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z}))|x,\tilde{z}]-c.$$\n\nIn the standard Morris-Shin model the set of equilibria is given by the solutions to the equation \n\n$$H(x,x,\tilde{z})=0$$\n\nHere things are a bit more involved due to irreversibility. First suppose there is a unique solution to this equation. Here the condition that insures uniqueness for all values of z is $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{\\alpha_{\tilde{z}}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}}\\leq\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\end{array}$ , which can be written as $\\alpha_{z}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{x}}\\leq\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ . Notice that a more precise private signal now also helps to generate multiplicity, because this means that the public signal is more precise. If this condition fails there is a range of values $[\\underline{{z}},\bar{z}]$ for $\tilde{z}$ over which there is multiplicity. For now we have assumed that we're outside of this multiplicity range. Denote the unique solution as $x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z}).If x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z})\\geq x_{1}^{*}$ we have found an equilibrium. It will be useful to describe the equilibrium by two thresholds,which turn out to be the the same in this case. First there is the threshold below which agents participate in the attack, denoted as $x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ which is equal to $x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ in this case. Second there is the threshold at which an agent is indifferent, denoted as $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ and also equal to $x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ in this case. The two thresholds are no longer the same if $x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}$ . Now the participation threshold is $x_{p}^{*}(\tilde{z})=x_{1}^{*}$ : nobody joins the attack but those with signal below $x_{1}^{*}$ are stuck with their earlier decision. Notice that due to uniqueness and the fact that $x_{U}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}$ we must have $H(x_{1}^{*},x_{1}^{*},\tilde{z})<0$ ,so an agent with private signal $x_{1}^{*}$ would like to reverse his decision but cannot due so. Thus the indifference threshold which is determined by the condition $H\big(x_{1}^{*},x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z}),\tilde{z}\big)=0$ must satisfy $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}.^{1}$ Why is it important to determine the indifference threshold?After all, in equilibrium everybody below $x_{1}^{*}$ has already decided to attack. The answer is that when deciding on whether to attack in the first stage, agents must \n\n$$b{P}[\theta\\leq\\Theta(x_{1}^{*})|x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z}),\tilde{z}]-c=0.$$\n\ncontemplate in what situations they would like to attack in the second stage given that everybody else below $x_{1}^{*}$ attacks in the first stage.\n\nNow suppose we are in the case of multiplicity. I will focus on the typical case with three solutions to the equation $H(x,x,\tilde{z})=0$ , the extension to the borderline cases with two equilibria is straightforward. Denote the three solutions as $x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})<$ $x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ . We have several cases to consider:\n\n(a)$x_{1}^{*}\\leq x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ : all three values $x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z}),x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ and $x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ are equilibria (with identical participation and indifference threshold).\n\n(b)$x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}<x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ : now the value $x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ no longer constitutes an equilibrium.Since $x_{1}^{*}$ is larger than $x_{L}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ but still belw $x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ we have $H(x_{1}^{*},x_{1}^{*},\tilde{z})<0$ ,so we get an equilibrium with participation threshold $x_{P}^{*}(\tilde{z})=x_{1}^{*}$ and indifference threshold $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}$ solving $H(x_{1}^{*},x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z}),\tilde{z})=0$ . The other two values $x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ and $x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ still give equilibria with identical participation and indifference threshold.\n\n(c)$x_{M}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}<x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ :now the intermediate value no longer gives an equilibrium.Moreover, since $x_{1}^{*}$ is now between the intermediate and the large value, we have $H\big(x_{1}^{*},x_{1}^{*},\tilde{z}\big)>0$ . This means that given a participation threshold $x_{1}^{*}$ , agents with signal signal $x_{1}^{*}$ are happy to attack in the second stage. So there is no equilibrium with participation threshold $x_{1}^{*}$ and indifference threshold $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}$ . We are only left with the equilibrium $x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})$ with identical participation and indifference threshold.\n\n(d)$x_{H}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*};$ : now even the large value no longer gives an equilibrium. Once again we have $H\big(x_{1}^{*},x_{1}^{*},\tilde{z}\big)<0$ , so we have an equilibrium with participation threshold $x_{P}^{*}(\tilde{z})=x_{1}^{*}$ and indifference threshold $x_{I}^{*}(\tilde{z})<x_{1}^{*}$",

If there are integers $x$ $y,z$ for which x $\\alpha+y\\beta+z\\gamma=0$ , then we have that $(x-y)\\alpha=(y-z)\\gamma-\\pi y$ ,whence it follows that we may take $r=|x-y|$ and $s=|y-z|$ (noting $r=s=0$ implies the absurd $x=y=z)$ .Conversely, given such r and s with $\\cos(r\\alpha)=\\pm\\cos(s\\gamma)$ 1, then it follows that $r\\alpha\\pm s\\gamma=k\\pi=k{\\big(}\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma{\\big)}$ for some $k,$ so the triangle is quirky.\n\nIf $r=0$ ,then by rational root theorem on $P_{s}(X)\\pm2$ it follows $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{n-4}{n-1}}$ must be an integer which occurs only when $n=4{\\mathrm{~(r e c a l l~}}n\\geq3{\\mathrm{)}}$ . Similarly we may discard the case $s=0$ Thus in what follows assume $n\\neq4$ and $r,s>0$ . Then, from the fact that $P_{r}$ and $P_{s}$ are nonconstant monic polynomials, we find \n\n## Corollary \n\nIf $n\\neq4$ works, then when $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{n+4}{n+1}}$ and $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{n-4}{n-1}}$ are written as fractions in lowest terms, the denominators have the same set of prime factors.\n\n\nBut gcd $(n+1,n-1)$ divides 2, and $\\operatorname*{g c d}(n+4,n+1)$ 1,$\\operatorname*{g c d}(n-4,n-1)$ divide 3. So we only have three possibilities:\n\n$n+1=2^{u}{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}n-1=2^{v}{\\mathrm{~f o~}}$ or some u,$v\\geq0$ . This is only possible if $n=3$ .

This time, when $r s=0$ , we get the extra solutions $(1,0),(4,1)$ , and \n\n$(5,2)$ \n\n\nFor $r s\\neq0$ , by triangle inequality, we have $x-y\\leq x+y<3(x-y)$ , and min $(\\nu_{2}(x-$ $y),\\nu_{2}(x+y))\\leq1$ , so it follows one of $x-y{\\mathrm{~o r~}}x+y$ must be in $\\{1,2,3,6\\}$ ·. An exhaustive check then leads to \n\n$$(x,y)\\in\\{(3,1),(5,1),(7,1),(11,5)\\}\\cup\\{(1,0),(5,2),(4,1)\\}$$\n\nas the solution set. And in fact they all work.\n\nIn conclusion the equilateral triangle,$3-5-7$ triangle (which has a 120°angle) and $6-11-16$ triangle (which satisfies $B=3A+4C)$ are exactly the new quirky triangles (up to similarity) whose sides are integers in arithmetic progression.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "The only possible value of the common perimeter, denoted p, is 1.\n\nSynthetic approach (from author). We prove the converse of the problem first:\n\nClaim $(p=1$ implies concurrence) — Suppose the six points are chosen so that triangles $A B_{2}C_{1},B C_{2}A_{1},C A_{2}B_{1}$ all have perimeter 1. Then lines $\\overline{{B_{1}C_{2}}},\\overline{{C_{1}A_{2}}}$ , and $\\overline{{A_{1}B_{2}}}$ are concurrent.\n\nProof. The perimeter conditions mean that $\\overline{{B_{2}C_{1}}},\\overline{{C_{2}A_{1}}}$ ,and $\\overline{{A_{2}B_{1}}}$ are tangent to the incircle of $\\triangle A B C$ \n\n$$C_{1}$$\n\n$$B_{2}$$\n\n$$C_{2}$$\n\n$$B_{1}$$\n\n$$A_{1}$$\n\nHence the result follows by Brianchon\\'s theorem.\n\n□\n\nNow suppose $p\\neq1$ . Let $\\overline{{B_{2}^{\\prime}C_{1}^{\\prime}}}$ be the dilation of $\\overline{{B_{2}C_{1}}}$ with ratio $\\frac{1}{p}$ at center $A$ , and define $C_{2}^{\\prime},A_{1}^{\\prime},A_{2}^{\\prime},B_{1}^{\\prime}$ similarly. The following diagram showcases the situation $p<1$ \n\n$$B_{2}$$\n\n$$C_{1}$$\n\n$$B_{2}^{\\prime}$$\n\nBy the reasoning in the.$p=1$ . case, note that $\\overline{{B_{1}^{\\prime}C_{2}^{\\prime}}},\\:\\overline{{C_{1}^{\\prime}A_{2}^{\\prime}}}$ _,and $\\overline{{A_{1}^{\\prime}B_{2}^{\\prime}}}$ are concurrent.However,$\\overline{{B_{1}C_{2}}},\\overline{{C_{1}A_{2}}},\\overline{{A_{1}B_{2}}}$ lie in the interior of quadrilaterals $B C B_{1}^{\\prime}C_{2}^{\\prime},C A C_{1}^{\\prime}A_{2}^{\\prime}$ ,and $A B A_{1}^{\\prime}B_{2}^{\\prime}$ , and these quadrilaterals do not share an interior point, a contradiction.\n\nThus $p\\geq1$ . Similarly, we can show $p\\leq1$ , and so $p=1$ is forced (and achieved if, for example, the threetriangles areequilateral with side length $1/3)$ )\n\nBarycentric solution (by Carl, Krit, Milan). We show that, if the common perimeter is 1, then the lines concur. To do this, we use barycentric coordinates. Let $A=(1:0:0)$ 1,$B=(0:1:0)$ ,,and $C=(0:0:1)$ . Let $A_{1}=(0:1-a_{1}:a_{1}),\\;A_{2}=(0:a_{2}:1-a_{2})$ ,,$B_{1}=(b_{1}:0:1-b_{1}),B_{2}=(1-b_{2}:0:b_{2})$ |,$C_{1}=(1-c_{1}:c_{1}:0)$ 1, and $C_{2}=(c_{2}:1-c_{2}:0)$ 1.The line $B_{1}C_{2}$ is defined by the equation \n\n$$\\det\\begin{bmatrix}x&y&z\\\\ b_{1}&0&1-b_{1}\\\\ c_{2}&1-c_{2}&0\\end{bmatrix}=0;$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$x\\big(-(1-b_{1})(1-c_{2})\\big)+y\\big((1-b_{1})c_{2}\\big)+z\\big(b_{1}(1-c_{2})\\big)=0.$$\n\nComputing the equations for the other lines cyclically, we get that the lines $B_{1}C_{2},C_{1}A_{2}$ and $A_{1}B_{2}$ _concur if and only if \n\n$$\\operatorname*{d e t}\\left[\\begin{matrix}{-(1-b_{1})(1-c_{2})}&{(1-b_{1})c_{2}}&{b_{1}(1-c_{2})}\\\\ {c_{1}(1-a_{2})}&{-(1-c_{1})(1-a_{2})}&{(1-c_{1})a_{2}}\\\\ {(1-a_{1})b_{2}}&{a_{1}(1-b_{2})}&{-(1-a_{1})(1-b_{2})}\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right]=0.$$\n\nLet this matrix be M. We also define the similar matrix \n\n$$N=\\left[\\begin{matrix}{-(1-b_{2})(1-c_{1})}&{(1-b_{2})c_{1}}&{b_{2}(1-c_{1})}\\\\ {c_{2}(1-a_{1})}&{-(1-c_{2})(1-a_{1})}&{(1-c_{2})a_{1}}\\\\ {(1-a_{2})b_{1}}&{a_{2}(1-b_{1})}&{-(1-a_{2})(1-b_{1})}\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right].$$\n\nGeometrically, det $N=0$ if and only if $B_{2}^{\\prime}C_{1}^{\\prime},C_{2}^{\\prime}A_{1}^{\\prime}$ ,and $A_{2}^{\\prime}B_{1}^{\\prime}$ concur, where for a point P on a side of triangle $A B C,P^{\\prime}$ denotes its reflection over that side\\'s midpoint.\n\n$${\\mathsf{C l a i m}}{\\mathrm{~—~W e~h a v e~}}\\operatorname*{d e t}M=\\operatorname*{d e t}N.$$\n\nProof. To show det $M=\\operatorname*{d e t}N$ ,it suffices to demonstrate that the determinant above is invariant under swapping subscripts of $ \\text{\"1\"}$ and $ \\text{\"2,\"}$ an operation we call \\Psi.\n\nWe use the definition of the determinant as a sum over permutations. The even permutations give us the following three terms:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{-(1-b_{1})(1-c_{2})(1-c_{1})(1-a_{2})(1-a_{1})(1-b_{2})}&{{}=-\\prod_{i=1}^{2}\\big((1-a_{i})(1-b_{i})(1-c_{i})\\big)}\\\\ {(1-a_{1})b_{2}(1-b_{1})c_{2}(1-c_{1})a_{2}}&{{}=\\big((1-a_{1})(1-b_{1})(1-c_{1})\\big)\\big(a_{2}b_{2}c_{2}\\big)}\\\\ {c_{1}(1-a_{2})a_{1}(1-b_{2})b_{1}(1-c_{2})}&{{}=\\big((1-a_{2})(1-b_{2})(1-c_{2})\\big)\\big(a_{1}b_{1}c_{1}\\big).}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe first term is invariant under \\Psi, while the second and third terms are swapped under \\Psi. For the odd permutations, we have a contribution to the determinant of \n\n$$\\sum_{\\mathrm{c y c}}(1-b_{1})(1-c_{2})(1-c_{1})a_{2}a_{1}(1-b_{2});$$\n\neach summand is invariant under \\Psi. This finishes the proof of our claim.\n\n口\n\nNow, it suffices to show that, if $A B_{2}C_{1},B C_{2}A_{1}$ ,and $C A_{2}B_{1}$ each have perimeter 1,then \n\n$$\\operatorname*{d e t}\\left[\\begin{matrix}{-(1-b_{2})(1-c_{1})}&{(1-b_{2})c_{1}}&{b_{2}(1-c_{1})}\\\\ {c_{2}(1-a_{1})}&{-(1-c_{2})(1-a_{1})}&{(1-c_{2})a_{1}}\\\\ {(1-a_{2})b_{1}}&{a_{2}(1-b_{1})}&{-(1-a_{2})(1-b_{1}).}\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right]=0.$$\n\nIndeed, we have $A B_{2}=b_{2}{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}A C_{1}=c_{1}$ , so by the law of cosines,\n\n$$1-b_{2}-c_{1}=1-A B_{2}-A C_{1}=B_{2}C_{1}={\\sqrt{b_{2}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}-b_{2}c_{1}}}.$$\n\nThis gives \n\n$$(1-b_{2}-c_{1})^{2}=b_{2}^{2}+c_{1}^{2}-b_{2}c_{1}\\implies1-2b_{2}-2c_{1}+3b_{2}c_{1}=0.$$\n\nSimilarly,$1-2c_{2}-2a_{1}+3c_{2}a_{1}=0{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}1-2a_{2}-2b_{1}+3a_{2}b_{1}=0.$ Now,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}N\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}&=\\begin{bmatrix}-(1-b_2)(1-c_1)+(1-b_2)c_1+b_2(1-c_1)\\\\-(1-c_2)(1-a_1)+(1-c_2)a_1+c_2(1-a_1)\\\\-(1-a_2)(1-b_1)+(1-a_2)b_1+a_2(1-b_1)\\end{bmatrix}\\\\&=\\begin{bmatrix}-1+2b_2+2c_1-3b_2c_1\\\\-1+2c_2+2a_1-3c_2a_1\\\\-1+2a_2+2b_1-2a_2b_1\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo it follows det $N=0$ , as desired.",

It is clear that these sets all satisfy the needed condition.\nFirst, assume that some four points on S lie on a circle, say A, B, C,and D, in that order. We claim that the rest of S lies on the circle,or S consists of exactly one more point, either the intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by A, B, C, D, or the intersection of two sides of the guadrilateral outside the circle. Assume there exists a point E in S, not on the circle. Then, E, A, B,C are not concyclic,and A, B, C are not collinear, so E lies on one of segments AB, BC,CA.Without loss of generality, say E lies on AB. Now, consider E, B, C, D;by similar logic to before, E lies on BC, CD, or DB, but since E, A, B are collinear, and A,B,C are not collinear, we need E, B, Dto be collinear, that is,$E=AB\\cap CD$ \nHowever, note that at most one of these intersection points can be in S, because if not, it is easy to check that we will get a triangle with a point in the interior in S, in which we have four points that cannot satisfy the given condition. Additionally, we can have at most four points on the circle, because if we have five, say A, B,C,D, E, and a sixth point P in S lies of the circle (we know that at most one such point exists, from before), then it must be the intersection of two lines formed by A,$B,C,D;$ without loss of generality, say $P=A B\\cap C D$ Also, it must be the intersection of two lines formed by A, B, C, E. But $P\\in A B,\\mathrm{s o}\\;P\\in C E$ , which is impossible, since this means C, D, E are collinear.\nWe are now left with the case when no four points are concyclic, which means that any four points in S have some three collinear. Starting with four points A, B,C, D, some three are collinear, say A, B,C. But  for any other point $E\\;\\in\\;S$ , some three of A, B, C, E are collinear,meaning all four must be collinear. Thus, all or all but one of our points must lie on the same line.\nThis exhausts all cases, and when there are fewer than four points in $S,$ ,the statement is vacuously true. It follows that the only possible sets S are those described above.",

In that case, using those two stones to fill the empty box does not change the value of S, but decreases the total number of stones by one, as desired.□\n\nFrom here we may then extract the answer to the original problem: we require all $a_{i}$ to be even and $\\textstyle\\sum a_{i}=2n-2$ \n\n\n\nRemark. It should be unsurprising that a criteria of this form exists, since (1) intuitively,one loses nothing by filling empty boxes as soon as possible, and then ignoring boxes with one pebble in them, (2) the set of configurations is a graded partially ordered set, so one can inductively look at small cases.",

Therefore, the sum of the three fractional terms must be an integer.\n\nThe sum is greater than 0 because each of the terms is positive, and the sum is less than 2because $\textstyle\frac{96}{97}+\frac{96}{97}+\frac{1}{97}<2$ . Therefore,the sum must be 1. Since $a^{4}=a,a^{5}=a^{2},a^{6}=1,\\ldots$ ,the sum of every group of three consecutive terms is 1. We can form 32 groups of 3 consecutive terms,so the total is 32. Since there are two elements with order 3,the total in this case is $2\\cdot32=64$ :Case 3:${\\mathrm{o r d}}_{n}(a)$ is even. Let orc $\\operatorname{l}_{n}(a)=2k$ .

      "text": "Ana and Banana are playing a game. First Ana picks a word, which is defined to be a nonempty sequence of capital English letters. Then Banana picks a nonnegative integer k and challenges Ana to supply a word with exactly k subsequences which are equal to Ana's word. Ana wins if she is able to supply such a word, otherwise she loses. For example, if Ana picks the word $ ``\\mathrm{TST}''$ , and Banana chooses $k=4$ then Ana can supply the word $ ``\\mathrm{TSTST}''$ which has 4 subsequences which are equal to Ana's word. Which words can Ana pick so that she can win no matter what value of k Banana chooses?",

    "answer": {
      "text": "First we introduce some notation. Define a block of letters to be a maximal contiguous subsequence of consecutive letters. For example, the word AABBBCAAA has four blocks, namely AA, BBB, C, AAA. Throughout the solution, we fix the word A that Ana picks, and introduce the following notation for its m blocks: $$A=A_{1}A_{2}\\ldots A_{m}=\\underbrace{a_{1}\\ldots a_{1}}_{x_{1}}\\underbrace{a_{2}\\ldots a_{2}}_{x_{2}}\\ldots\\underbrace{a_{m}\\ldots a_{m}}_{x_{m}}.$$ A rainbow will be a subsequence equal to Ana's initial word A (meaning Ana seeks words with exactly k rainbows). Finally, for brevity, let $A_{i}=\\underbrace{a_{i}\\ldots a_{i}}_{x_{i}},\\mathrm{s o}A=A_{1}\\ldots A_{m}.$ We prove two claims that resolve the problem. Claim ${\\mathrm{~\\text{--}~}}{\\mathrm{~I f~}}x_{i}=1$ for some i, then for any $k\\geq1$ , the word $$W=A_{1}\\ldots A_{i-1}\\underbrace{a_{i}\\ldots a_{i}}_{k}A_{i+1}\\ldots A_{m}$$ obtained by repeating the ith letter k times has exactly k rainbows. Proof. Obviously there are at least ${\\binom{k}{k-1}}=k$ rainbows, obtained by deleting $k-1$ choices of the letter $a_{i}$ in the repeated block. We show they are the only ones. Given a rainbow, consider the location of this singleton block in W. It cannot occur within the first $|A_{1}|{+}{\\cdots}{+}|A_{i-1}|$ letters, nor can it occur within the final $|A_{i+1}|{+}{\\cdots}{+}|A_{m}|$ letters. So it must appear in the ith block of W. That implies that all the other (c)$a_{i}$ 's in the ith block of W must be deleted, as desired. (This last argument is actually nontrivial,and has some substance; many students failed to realize that the upper bound requires care.) $\\mathsf{C l a i m}\\mathrm{~—~I f~}x_{i}\\geq2$ for all i, then no word W has exactly two rainbows. Proof. We prove if there are two rainbows of W, then we can construct at least three rainbows. Let $W=w_{1}\\ldots w_{n}$ ,and consider the two rainbows of W. Since they are not the same,there must be a block $A_{p}$ of the rainbow, of length $\\ell\\geq2$ , which do not occupy the same locations in W. Assume the first rainbow uses $w_{i_{1}},\\:\\ldots,\\:w_{i_{\\ell}}$ for this block and the second rainbow uses $w_{j_{1}},\\ldots,w_{j_{\\ell}}$ for this block. Then among the letters $w_{q}$ for min $(i_{1},j_{1})\\leq q\\leq\\operatorname*{m a x}(i_{\\ell},j_{\\ell})$ there must be at least $\\ell+1$ copies of the letter $a_{p}$ . Moreover, given a choice of copies of the letter $a_{p}$ in this range, one can complete the subsequence to a rainbow. So the number of rainbows is at least $\\textstyle{\\binom{\\ell+1}{\\ell}}\\geq\\ell+1$ Since $\\ell\\geq2$ , this proves W has at least three rainbows. 厂 In summary, Ana wins if and only if $x_{i}=1$ for some $i.$ since she can duplicate the isolated letter k times; but if $x_{i}\\geq2$ for all i then Banana only needs to supply $k=2$",

Observe that $f$ is in the image of $\\Delta^{k}$ for any $k.$ because $\\Delta^{m N}f=f$ for any m. The following lemma will be useful.\n\nLemma \n\nLet $g\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e}\\mathbb{Z}$ be any function, and let $h=\\Delta^{p^{d}}g$ .Then \n\n$h(x)+h(x+p^d)+\\cdots+h(x+(b-1)p^d)\\equiv0\\pmod{p}$ \nfor all x.\n\nProof. By definition,\n\n$$h(x)=\\Delta^{p^{d}}g(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{p^{d}}(-1)^{k}{\\binom{p^{d}}{k}}g(x+p^{d}-k).$$\n\nHowever, it is known that $\\binom{p^{d}}{k}$ is a multiple of p if $1\\leq k\\leq p^{d}-1$ ,so \n\n$$h(x)\\equiv g(x+p^{d})+(-1)^{p^{d}}g(x){\\pmod{p}}.$$\n\nUsing this, we easily obtain \n\n$$\\begin{align*}&\\quad h(x)+h(x+p^d)+\\cdots+h(x+(b-1)p^d)\\\\&\\equiv\\begin{cases}0&p>2,\\\\2(g(x)+g(x+p^d)+\\cdots+g(x+(b-1)p^d))&p=2,\\end{cases}\\\\&\\equiv0\\pmod{p},\\end{align*}$$\n\nas desired.\n\n□\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r}{\\overbrace{\\mathrm{\\boldmath~\\mathbb{C}o r o l l a r y}}^{\\mathrm{\\boldmath~\\mathbb{C}o r o l l a r y}}\\quad}\\\\ {\\mathrm{L e t}~g\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e}\\mathbb{Z}\\mathrm{~b e~a n y~f u n c t i o n,~a n d~l e t~}h=\\Delta^{e p^{d}}g.\\mathrm{~T h e n}}\\\\ {\\quad h(x)+h(x+p^{d})+\\cdots+h(x+(b-1)p^{d})=0}\\\\ {\\quad\\mathrm{~f o r~a l l~}x.}\\end{array}$$\n\nProof. Starting with the lemma, define \n\n$$h_{1}(x)=\\frac{h(x)+h(x+p^{d})+\\cdots+h(x+(b-1)p^{d})}{p}.$$\n\nApplying the lemma to $h_{1}$ shows the corollary for $e=2$ ,since $h_{1}(x)$ , is divisible by p,hence the numerator is divisible by $p^{2}$ . Continue in this manner to get the result for general $e>2$ □This immediately settles this direction, since f is in the image of $\\Delta^{e p^{d}}$ \n\nProof the equation implies essential Let S be the set of all functions satisfying $2;$ then it\\'s easy to see that \\Delta is a function on S. To show that all functions in $\\mathcal{S}$ are essential, it\\'s equivalent to show that \\Delta is a permutation on S.\n\nWe will show that \\Delta is injective on S. Suppose otherwise, and consider two functions $f,$ ,g in $\\mathcal{S}$ with $\\Delta f=\\Delta g$ . Then, we obtain that f and g differ by a constant; say $g=f+\\lambda$ However, then \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}&g(0)+g(p^e)+\\cdots+g((b-1)p^e)\\\\=&(f(0)+\\lambda)+(f(p^e)+\\lambda)+\\cdots+(f((b-1)p^e)+\\lambda)\\\\=&b\\lambda.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis should also be zero. Since $p\\nmid b,$ , we obtain $\\lambda=0$ , as desired.\n\nCounting Finally, we can count the essential functions: all but the last $p^{d}$ entries can be chosen arbitrarily, and then each remaining entry has exactly one possible choice.This leads to a count of \n\n$$(p^{e})^{a-p^{d}}=p^{e(a-p^{\\nu_{p}(a)})},$$\n\nas promised.\n\nSecond solution by Daniel Zhu. There are two parts to the proof: solving the $e=1$ case, and using the $e=1$ .result to solve the general problem by induction on e. These parts are independent of each other.\n\nThe case $e=1$ Represent functions f as elements \n\n$$\\alpha_{f}\\mathrel{\\mathop:}=\\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}}f(-k)x^{k}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]/(x^{a}-1)$$\n\nThen, since $\\alpha_{\\Delta f}=(x-1)\\alpha_{f}$ , we wish to find the number of $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]/(x^{a}-1)$ such that $(x-1)^{m}\\alpha=\\alpha$ : for some m.\n\nNow, make the substitution $y=x-1$ and let $P(y)=(y+1)^{a}-1;$ ; we want to find $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}[y]/(P(y))$ such that .$y^{m}\\alpha=\\alpha$ :for some m.\n\nIf we write $P(y)=y^{d}Q(y)$ with $Q(0)\\neq0$ , then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem we have the ring isomorphism \n\n$$\\mathbb{F}_{p}[y]/(P(y))\\cong\\mathbb{F}_{p}[y]/(y^{d})\\times\\mathbb{F}_{p}[y]/(Q(y)).$$\n\nNote that y is nilpotent in the first factor, while it is a unit in the second factor. So the \\alpha that work are exactly those that are zero in the first factor; thus there are $p^{a-d}$ such \\alpha.We can calculate $d=p^{v_{p}(a)}$ (via, say, Lucas\\'s Theorem), so we are done.\n\nThe general problem The general idea is as follows: call a $f\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e}\\mathbb{Z}$ e-good if $\\Delta^{m}f=f$ for some m. Our result above allows us to count the 1-good functions. Then,if $e\\geq1$ _,every $(e+1){\\scriptstyle{\\mathrm{-g o o d}}}$ function, when reduced mod $p^{e}$ , yields an e-good function,so we count $(e+1)$ -good functions by counting how many reduce to any given e-good function.\n\nFormally, we use induction on e, with the $e=1$ case being treated above. Suppose now we have solved the problem for a given $e\\geq1$ , and we now wish to solve it for $e+1$ For any function $g\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e+1}\\mathbb{Z}$ , let $\\bar{g}\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e}\\mathbb{Z}$ be its reduction mod $p^{e}$ ,For a given e-good $f,$ let $n(f)$ be the number of $(e+1){\\mathrm{-g o o d~}}g$ \\'with $\\bar{g}=f$ . The following two claims now finish the problem:\n\nClaim — If f is e-good, then $n(f)>0$ \n\nProof. Suppose $m$ is such that $\\Delta^{m}f=f$ . Pick any g with $\\bar{g}=f$ , and consider the sequence of functions \n\n$$g,\\Delta^{m}g,\\Delta^{2m}g,\\ldots.$$\n\nSince there are finitely many functions $\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}/p^{e+1}\\mathbb{Z}$ , there must exist $a<b$ such that $\\Delta^{a m}g=\\Delta^{b m}g$ 1. We claim $\\Delta^{a m}g$ is the desired $(e+1)$ -good function. To see this,first note that since $\\overline{{\\Delta^{k}g}}=\\Delta^{k}\\bar{g}$ , we must have $\\overline{{\\Delta^{a m}g}}=\\Delta^{a m}f=f$ . Moreover,\n\n$$\\Delta^{(b-a)m}(\\Delta^{a m}q)=\\Delta^{b m}q=\\Delta^{a m}q,v$$\n\nso $\\Delta^{a m}g$ is $(e+1)$ -good.\n\n□\n\nClaim— If f is $e\\operatorname{-g o o d}$ ., and $n(f)>0$ ,then $n(f)$ is exactly the number of l-good functions, i.e.$p^{a-p^{v_{p}(a)}}$ \n\nProof. Let g be any $(e+1)$ |-good function with $\\bar{g}=f$ . We claim that the $(e+1){\\mathrm{-g o o d~}}g_{1}$ with $\\bar{g}_{1}=f$ are exactly the functions of the form $g+p^{e}h$ for any 1-good h. Since these functions are clearly distinct, this characterization will prove the claim.\n\nTo show that this condition is sufficient, note that $\\overline{{g+p^{e}h}}=\\bar{g}=f$ . Moreover, if $\\Delta^{m}g=g$ and $\\Delta^{m^{\\prime}}h=h$ ,then \n\n$$\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}(g+p^{e}h)=\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}g+p^{e}\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}h=g+p^{e}h.$$\n\nTo show that this condition is necessary, let $g_{1}$ be any $(e+1)$ -good function such that $\\bar{g}_{1}=f$ . Then $g_{1}-g$ is also $(e+1){\\mathrm{-g o o d}}$ ,since if $\\Delta^{m}g=g,\\Delta^{m^{\\prime}}g_{1}=g_{1}$ ,we have \n\n$$\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}(g_{1}-g)=\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}g_{1}-\\Delta^{m m^{\\prime}}g=g_{1}-g.$$\n\nOn the other hand, we also know that $g_{1}-g$ is divisible by $p^{e}$ . This means that it must be $p^{e}h$ for some function $f\\colon\\mathbb{Z}/a\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ ,and it is not hard to show that $g_{1}-g$ being $(e+1)$ )-good means that h is 1-good.□",

The idea is to take two large primes and use Bezout's theorem, but the details require significant care.\n\nWe start by solving the case where $n\\geq9$ .

(This case is actually possible in a few edge cases, for example when $n=9,q=7,p=5.)$ \n\nIt remains to resolve the cases where $3\\leq n\\leq8$ . We enumerate these cases manually:\n\n• For $n=3$ , let $a_{n}=(-1)^{\\nu_{3}(n)}$ \n\n$$\\bullet\\mathrm{F o r}n=4,\\mathrm{l e t}a_{n}=(-1)^{\\nu_{2}(n)+\\nu_{3}(n)}.$$\n\n$$\\bullet\\mathrm{F o r}n=5,\\mathrm{l e t}a_{n}=(-2)^{\\nu_{5}(n)}.$$\n\n$$\\bullet\\mathrm{F o r}n=6,\\mathrm{l e t}a_{n}=5^{\\nu_{2}(n)}\\cdot3^{\\nu_{3}(n)}\\cdot(-42)^{\\nu_{5}(n)}.$$\n\n$$\\bullet\\mathrm{F o r}n=7,\\mathrm{l e t}a_{n}=(-3)^{\\nu_{7}(n)}.$$\n\n• For $n=8$ , we can choose $(p,q)=(5,7)$ in the prior construction.\n\nThis completes the constructions for all $n>2$",

One can also attempt a direct hypothesis test on the difference in means. This is more work than needed, given we already determined confidence intervals. However, if a hypothesis test is used, we should be careful not to assume the variances are the same (we have strong evidence they are not), and so we would then need to use the somewhat complicated procedure described in Montgomery, pp. 120-121. (2) Yes – here the 95% confidence intervals for the new variance and old do not overlap. We are 95% confident or better that the chance has resulted in a process with larger variance. Here also, one can formulate a hypothesis test as an alternative approach. Given that one variance appears to be so much larger than the other, we're best off using a one sided Ftest (that is to say, the one sided test will require even larger ratio to declare a larger variance, and thus the one sided test is more conservative). So in this case, we would need to observe an $F>F_{0}$ ,where $F_{0}=F_{0.05,n_{b}-1,n_{a}-1}=F_{0.05,10,60}=1.99$ '. In our case, we observe $F=\\frac{s_{b}^{2}}{s_{a}^{2}}=\\frac{20}{6}=3.33$ giving us better than 95% confidence that the second variance is larger than the first.",

A member of the audience draws two cards from two different boxes and announces the sum of numbers on those cards. Given this information, the magician locates the box from which no card has been drawn.\n\nHow many ways are there to put the cards in the three boxes so that the trick works?",

      "text": "There are $2\\cdot3!=12$ ways, which amount to:\n\n• Partitioning the cards modulo 3, or \n\n•Placing 1 alone in a box, 100 alone in a second box, and all remaining cards in the third box.\n\n\n\nThese are easily checked to work so we prove they are the only ones.\n\n( First solution. We proceed by induction on $n\\geq3$ with the base case being immediate.For the inductive step, consider a working partition of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ Then either n is in its own box; or deleting n gives a working partition of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ Similarly,either 1 is in its own box; or deleting 1 gives a working partition of $\\{2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$ ,and we can reduce all numbers by 1 to get a working partition of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ \n\nTherefore, we only need to consider there cases.\n\n•If 1 and n are both in their own box, this yields one type of solution we already found.\n\n\n\n•If n is not in a box by itself, then by induction hypothesis the cards 1 through $n-1$ . are either arranged mod 3, or as $\\{1\\}\\cup\\{2,3,\\ldots,n-2\\}\\cup\\{n-1\\}$ \n\n– In the former mod 3 situation, since $n+(n-3)=(n-1)+(n-2)$ ,so n must be in the same box as $n-3$ ：\n\n– In the latter case and for $n>4$ ,since $n+1=2+(n-1)$ , n must be in the same box as 1. But nw $n+2=(n-1)+3$ for $n>4$ ,contradiction.\n\n•The case where 1 is in a box by itself is analogous.\n\nThis exhausts all cases, completing the proof.\n\nSecond solution. Let A, B, C be the sets of cards in the three boxes. Then $A+B$ $B+C,C+A$ should be disjoint, and contained in $\\{3,4,\\ldots,199\\}$ . On the other hand,we have the following famous fact.\n\n\n\n## Lemma \n\nLet X and Y be finite nonempty sets of real numbers. We have $|X{+}Y|\\geq|X|{+}|Y|{-}1$ with equality if and only if X and Y are arithmetic progressions with the same common difference, or one of X and Y is a singleton set.\n\n\n\nPutting these two together gives the estimates \n\n$$197\\geq|A+B|+|B+C|+|C+A|\\geq2\\left(|A|+|B|+|C|\\right)-3=197.$$\n\nSo all the inequalities must be sharp. Consequently we conclude that:\n\nClaim— Either the sets A, B, C are disjoint arithmetic progressions with the same common difference $\\begin{array}{r}{d=\\operatorname*{m i n}_{x\\neq y}}\\end{array}$ in same set $|x-y|$ , or two of the sets are two singleton.Moreover,$\\{3,4,\\ldots,199\\}={\\widetilde{(A+B)}}\\sqcup(B+C)\\sqcup(C+A)$ \n\n\n\nFrom here it is not hard to deduce the layouts above are the only ones, but there are some details. First, we make the preliminary observation that $3=1+2,\\;4=1+3$ $198=98+100,199=99+100$ and these numbers can't be decomposed in other ways;thus from the remark about the disjoint union:\n\nClaim (Convenientcorollary)— The pairs1,2),(1,3),(98,100),(99,100)are all in different sets.\n\n\n\nWe now consider the four cases.\n\n• If two of the boxes are singletons, it follows from the corollary that we should have $A=\\{1\\},B=\\{100\\}{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}C=\\{2,\\ldots,99\\}$ ,up to permutation.\n\n• Otherwise A, B, C are disjoint arithmetic progressions with the same common difference d. As two of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ are in the same box (by pigeonhole), we must have $d\\leq3$ \n\n\n\n− If $d=3$ , then no two elements of different residues modulo 3 can be in the same box, so we must be in the first construction claimed earlier.\n\n$-{\\mathrm{~I f~}}d=2$ , then the convenient corollary tells us we may assume WLOG that $1\\in A$ and $2\\in B$ , hence $3\\in C$ (since $3\\notin A$ by convenient corollary, and $3\\notin B$ because common difference 2). Thus we must have $A=\\{1\\},B=$ $\\{2,4,\\ldots,100\\}$ and $C=\\{3,5,\\ldots99\\}$ which does not work since $1+4=2+3$ Therefore there are no solutions in this case.\n\n\n\n$-{\\mathrm{~I f~}}d=1$ ,then by convenient corollary the numbers 1 and 2 are in different sets,as are 99 and 100. So we must have $A=\\{1\\},B=\\{2,\\ldots,99\\},C=\\{100\\}$ which we have already seen is valid.",

An example with $(k,n)=(5,8)$ is shown below.\n\n\n\n$$\\left[\\begin{matrix}{w}&{w}&{w}&{w}&{w}&{x}&{a}&{b}\\\\ {y}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{x}&{a}&{b}\\\\ {y}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{x}&{a}&{b}\\\\ {y}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{x}&{a}&{b}\\\\ {y}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{x}&{a}&{b}\\\\ {y}&{z}&{z}&{z}&{z}&{z}&{}&{}\\\\ {c}&{c}&{c}&{c}&{c}&{}&{}&{}\\\\ {d}&{d}&{d}&{d}&{d}&{}&{}&{}\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right]$$\n\n\n\n•For $n=2k-1$ one places a domino in each column, alternating between upper-most possible and lower-most possible. An example with $(k,n)=(3,5)$ is shown belw.\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}a&&c&&e\\\\ a&&c&&e\\\\ a&b&c&d&e\\\\ &b&&d\\\\ &b&&d\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNow we now prove this is optimal.\n\nCall a row (resp column) bare if it contains no horizontal (resp vertical) domino contained completely inside it. The main observation is that:\n\nClaim— The bare columns are consecutive, as are the bare rows.\n\nProof. Consider a vertical domino $D\\mathrm{(s a y)}$ in some column $C.$ and assume it is in the left half of the board. Then the column to the left of C must also contain a domino,\n\notherwise we could add the domino exactly to the left of D since there is not enough space to fit a horizontal domino to $D^{\\mathrm{{s}}}$ left.\n\n\n\nInductively, then, every column left of C is not bare. Similarly, if C had been on the right half of the board, then all columns to the right of C are not bare.□\n\n\n\nTo finish, we consider two cases.\n\n\n\n•If there are no bare columns, then we need at least n dominoes, since each column contains a domino.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if there are no bare rows, we also need at least n dominoes.\n\n\n\n• In the case there exist at least one bare row or bare column, note that given k (consecutive) bare columns, then intersecting them with a bare row gives a place where we can add an additional domino, contradiction. So there are at most k bare columns, and hence at least $n-(k-1)=n-k+1$ vertical dominoes (one per non-bare column).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, there are at least $n-k+1$ horizontal dominoes. So there are at least $2(n-k+1)$ dominoes totall.\n\n\n\nThis shows one always needs at least min $\\operatorname{l}\\left(n,2(n-k+1)\\right)$ dominoes. This resolves every case except $k=n$ , (in which case the bound is true but not achievable). However, the case $k=n$ is trivial — just note that all the dominoes must have the same orientation when $k=n$ ,so we are necessarily in the first case.",

      "text": "The method of images can be used in some highly symmetric situations to compute the electric field in the vicinity of a conductor. Specifically, consider any configuration of static charges and take any equipotential surface containing some of the charges. Then the resulting field configuration outside that surface is the field configuration we would have if that surface bounded a conductor. This is simply because it hasconstant potential on the conductor surface, so it must be the right answer by the uniqueness theorem. Consider two conducting spheres of radius r separated by a distance $a\\gg r$ ,with total char ${\\mathrm{r g e s}}\\pm Q$ . The spheres can be thought of as the two plates of a capacitor. In reality, the exact capacitance of this system can be written as an infinite series in $r/a$ . Let's consider two ways of finding the corrections to the capacitance. * It turns out that the quantity $1/C$ is a bit nicer than C. At what order in $r/a$ does the second nontrivial correction to $1/C$ appear?",

    "answer": {
      "text": "As we've seen, the answer is a power series in $r/a$ , so we would guess that the next term is of order $(r/a)^{2}$ . However, the next term is actually of order $(r/a)^{4}$ This is difficult to see with the image charge method of part $(\\mathrm{c})$ . If you work it out, you'll find that the second order and third order corrections to $1/C$ cancel out, in a complicated way. On the other hand, it's intuitive if you consider the energy, as in part (b). This is the more natural quantity, since $U\\propto1/C$ We know that the leading correction to the charge distribution is the image charge $q_{1}=q_{0}r/a$ 7which is of center by $r^{2}/a$ . Thus, each sphere can be regarded as a point charge $Q$ at its center, plus a dipole moment $p_{1}\\sim Q r^{3}/a^{2}$ , plus higher order corrections. This dipole interacts with the point charge field of the other sphere with a potential energy $$\\Delta U\\sim\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\\sim\\frac{Q r^{3}}{a^{2}}\\frac{Q}{a^{2}}\\sim\\frac{Q^{2}r^{3}}{a^{4}}$$ which is order $(r/a)^{4}$ smaller than the leading term in $U$ , as promised. For much more about this problem, see this paper. The result we derived in part (b) matches its equation (2.2), upon identifying $Q_{a}\\rightarrow Q,Q_{b}\\rightarrow-Q,a,b\\rightarrow r$ ,and $c\\rightarrow a$ , and using cgs units where 47$\\tau\\epsilon_{0}=1$ The third correction shows up at order $(r/a)^{6}$ , and corresponds to a dipole-dipole interaction. As noted in the paper, Maxwell was so interested in this system that he calculated $1/C$ out to $22^{\\mathrm{n d}}$ order!",

Every second, one firefly moves to a new position so that its distance from each one of its friends is the same as it was before moving. This is the only way that the fireflies ever change their positions. No two fireflies may ever occupy the same point. Initially, no two fireflies, friends or not, are more than a meter away. Following some finite number of seconds, all fireflies find themselves at least ten million meters away from their original positions. Given this information, find the greatest possible number of friendships between the fireflies.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "In general, we show that when $n\\geq70$ , the answer is $\\textstyle f(n)=\\lfloor{\\frac{n^{2}}{3}}\\rfloor$ \n\nConstruction: Choose three pairwise parallel lines $\\ell_{A}$ ,$\\ell_{B}$ ,$\\ell_{C}$ forming an infinite equilateral triangle prism (with side larger than 1). Split the n fireflies among the lines as equally as possible, and say that two fireflies are friends iff they lie on different lines.To see this works:\n\n1. Reflect $\\ell_{A}$ and all fireflies on $\\ell_{A}$ in the plane containing $\\ell_{B}$ and $\\ell_{C}$ .\n\n2. Reflect $\\ell_{B}$ and all fireflies on $\\ell_{B}$ in the plane containing $\\ell_{C}$ and $\\ell_{A}$ ,\n\n3. Reflect $\\ell_{C}$ and all fireflies on $\\ell_{C}$ in the plane containing $\\ell_{A}$ and $\\ell_{B}$ .\n\n…\n\nProof: Consider a valid configuration of fireflies. If there is no 4-clique of friends, then by Turan's theorem, there are at most $f(n)$ pairs of friends.\n\n\nLet $g(n)$ be the answer, given that there exist four pairwise friends (say a, b, c, d).Note that for a firefly to move, all its friends must be coplanar.\n\nClaim (No coplanar $K_{4})\\mathrm{~\\overline{~}}~}$ We can't have four coplanar fireflies which are pairwise friends.\n\n\nProof. If we did, none of them could move (unless three are collinear, in which case they can't move).\n\n\nClaim (Key claim —tetrahedrons don't share faces often) — There are at most 12fireflies e which are friends with at least three of a, b, c, d.\n\nProof. First denote by A, B, C, D the locations of firefies $a$ ,$b.$ ,$c,$ d. These four positions change over time as fireflies move, but the tetrahedron ABCD always has a fixed shape,and we will take this tetrahedron as our reference frame for the remainder of the proof.\n\nWLOG, will assume that e is friends with a,$b.$ ,c. Then e will always be located at one of two points $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ relative to $A B C$ , such that $E_{1}A B C$ and $E_{2}A B C$ -$E_{2}A B C$ are two \n\ncongruent tetrahedrons with fixed shape. We note that points $D$ ,$E_{1}$ ,and $E_{2}$ are all different: clearly $D\\neq E_{1}$ and $E_{1}\\neq E_{2}$ .(If $D=E_{2}$ :, then some fireflies won't be able to move.)\n\n\nConsider the moment where firefly a moves. Its friends must be coplanar at that time,so one of $E_{1},E_{2}$ lies in plane BCD. Similar reasoning holds for planes ACD and ABD.So,$\\mathrm{W L O G}~E_{1}$ lies on both planes BCD and $A C D$ . Then $E_{1}$ lies on line $C D$ , and $E_{2}$ lies in plane ABD. This uniquely determines $(E_{1},E_{2})$ relative to $A B C D$ :\n\n$E_{1}$ is the intersection of line CD with the reflection of plane ABD in plane ABC.\n\n$E_{2}$ is the intersection of plane ABD with the reflection of line CD in plane ABC.\n\nAccounting for WLOGs, there are at most 12 possibilities for the set $\\{E_{1},E_{2}\\}$ ,and thus at most 12 possibilities for E. (It's not possible for both elements of one pair $\\{E_{1},E_{2}\\}$ to be occupied, because then they couldn't move.)\n\n\nThus, the number of friendships involving exactly one of a,$b,$ ,$c,$ d is at most $(n-16)$ $2+12\\cdot3=2n+4$ , So removing these four fireflies gives \n\n$$g(n)\\leq6+(2n+4)+\\operatorname*{m a x}\\{f(n-4),g(n-4)\\}.$$\n\nThe rest of the solution is bounding. When $n\\geq24$ :, we have $(2n+10)+f(n-4)\\leq f(n)$ SO \n\n$$g(n)\\leq\\operatorname*{m a x}\\{f(n),(2n+10)+g(n-4)\\}\\\\quad\\forall n\\geq24.$$\n\nBy iterating the above inequality, we get \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{}{g(n)\\leq\\operatorname*{m a x}\\Big\\{f(n),\\;(2n+10)}&{{}+(2(n-4)+10)}\\\\ {}&{{}+\\cdots+(2(n-4r)+10)+g(n-4r-4)\\Big\\},}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere r satisfies $n-4r-4<24\\leq n-4r$ \n\nNow \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{}&{{}\\quad(2n+10)+(2(n-4)+10)+\\cdots+(2(n-4r)+10)+g(n-4r-4)}\\\\ {}&{{}=(r+1)(2n-4r+10)+g(n-4r-4)}\\\\ {}&{{}\\leq\\left(\\frac{n}{4}-5\\right)(n+37)+\\binom{24}{2}.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis is less than $f(n)$ for_$n\\geq70$ , which concludes the solution.\n\nRemark. There are positive integers n such that it is possible to do better than $f(n)$ friendships. For instance,$f(5)=8$ , whereas five fireflies a, b, c,$d,$ and e as in the proof of the Lemma $(E_{1}$ being the intersection point of line CD with the reflection of plane (ABD)in plane $(ABC),E_{2}$ being the intersection point of plane $(A B D)$ with the reflection of line CD in plane $(A B C)$ , and tetrahedron ABCD being sufficiently arbitrary that points $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ exist and points $D,E_{1}$ , and $E_{2}$ are pairwise distinct) give a total of nine friendships.Remark (Author comments).It is natural to approach the problem by looking at the two-dimensional version first. In two dimensions, the following arrangement suggests itself almost immediately: We distribute all fireflies as equally as possible among two parallel lines, and two fireflies are friends if and only if they are on different lines. Similarly to the three-dimensional version, this attains the greatest possible number of friendships for all sufficiently large n, though not for all n. For instance, at least one friendlier arrangements exists for $n=4$ , similarly to the above friendlier arrangement for $n=5$ in three dimensions. This observation strongly suggests that in three dimensions we should distribute the fireflies as equally as possible among two parallel planes, and that two fireflies should be friends if and only if they are on different planes. It was a great surprise for me to discover that this arrangement does not in fact give the correct answer! Remark. On the other hand, Ankan Bhattacharya gives the following reasoning as to why the answer should not be that surprising: I think the answer $(10^{14}-1)/3$ is quite natural if you realize that $(n/2)^{2}$ is probably optimal in 2D and $\\binom{n}{2}$ is optimal in super high dimensions (i.e. around $n)$ .So going from dimension 2 to 3 should increase the answer (and indeed it does).",

However, in the case of infinite vertical walls, the $-1/2h$ term is not present.The de Broglie relation,$\\lambda=h/p$ , becomes a basis for intuition. If $V(x)$ is piece-wise constant, then the fractional number of wavelengths in each constant $V(x)$ region is $$\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda}=\\frac{\\Delta x}{h/p}$$ We are interested in the integer number of half-wavelengths between turning points.

Next, find the time-scale at which the center of mass of the particle cloud will settle.\n\n$$\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{setle}}=\\mathrm{h}/\\mathrm{w}_{\\mathrm{s}}=0.05\\mathrm{~m}/\\left(5.5\\mathrm{~x}10^{-5}\\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}\\right)=910\\mathrm{~s}.$$\nWith this time scale and the mean advection,$\\mathrm{u}=0.1$ cm/s (assumed constant over channel depth), the center of the cloud will settle at a distance $\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{u}\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{setle}}=91$ cm downstream from the source. The footprint of the particle cloud, i.e. its length and width, depends on the size of the cloud as it meets the bed. While in suspension, the particles spread in all directions by isotropic diffusion,$D=10^{-13}\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . Neglecting the boundary for a moment, at $\\mathrm{t}=\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{s e t t l e}}$ the particle cloud will be spherical with diameter $4\\sigma=4\\sqrt{(2x10^{-13}m^{2}s^{-1}x910s)}=5.4x10^{-5}$ n. Because the cloud is distributed vertically over a distance $\\approx4\\upsigma$ ,individual particles may settle slightly before or after the mean settling time given above. The range of settling times is $\\Delta\\mathrm{T}=4\\sigma/\\mathrm{w}_{\\mathrm{s}}=1\\mathrm{~s}$ ;With advection $u=0.1cm/s$ , the range of settling times will spread the particle patch longitudinally over a distance, ∆T $\\mathrm{u}=0.1$ cm. In addition, the cloud is already distributed over a longitudinal distance 4σ as it settles. But, the longitudinal spread due to diffusion while in suspension,$4\\sigma=0.005$ cm, is small compared to the longitudinal spread accomplished by the differential settling times (0.1 cm), so we ignore the former. Thus we expect the footprint of the particle cloud to be 0.1 cm long, 0.005 cm wide, and centered 91 cm downstream of the release. Given that the longitudinal distance traveled (91 cm) is much greater than the distribution caused by diffusion (0.1 cm), to first order the particles' fate is determined solely by the settling velocity and current speed, i.e. by advection. We could have predicted this apriori by considering the Peclet number based on the particle settling speed.$\\mathrm{Pe}=\\mathrm{w}_{\\mathrm{Ph}}/\\mathrm{D}=$ $3x10^{7}\\gg1$ , indicating that advective transport dominates in this case.",

From this we conclude that for any $f\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ ,there exists $h\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that \n\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\\sum_{\\omega\\in S_q}\\frac{f(\\omega)}{(1-\\omega)^{z_q}}&=\\sum_{\\eta\\in S_{q/p}}\\sum_{\\omega^p=\\eta}\\frac{f(\\omega)}{(1-\\omega)^{z_q}}\\\\&=\\sum_{\\eta\\in S_{q/p}}\\frac{h(\\eta)}{(1-\\eta)^{z_{q/p}}}.\\end{align*}$$\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, this is always an integer.\n\nIn the other direction, for $\\eta\\in S_{q/p}$ we have \n\n$$\\begin{align*}\\sum_{\\omega^{p}=\\eta}\\frac{B(\\omega)}{(1-\\omega)^{1+z_{q}}}&=\\sum_{\\omega^{p}=\\eta}\\frac{1}{p(1-\\omega^{p})^{z_{q/p}}(1-\\omega)}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{p(1-\\eta)^{z_{q/p}}}\\sum_{\\omega^{p}=\\eta}\\frac{1}{1-\\omega}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{p(1-\\eta)^{z_{q/p}}}\\left[\\frac{px^{p-1}}{x^{p}-\\eta}\\right]_{x=1}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{(1-\\eta)^{1+z_{q/p}}}.\\end{align*}$$\n\nSumming over all $\\eta\\in S_{q/p}$ , we conclude by the inductive hypothesis that \n\n$$\\sum_{\\omega\\in S_{q}}\\frac{B(\\omega)}{(1-\\omega)^{1+z_{q}}}=\\sum_{\\eta\\in S_{q/p}}\\frac{1}{(1-\\eta)^{1+z_{q/p}}}.$$\n\nis not an integer. This completes the solution.\n\n Solution 2 (Nikolai Beluhov). Suppose that the complex numbers $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{1-\\omega}}$ for $\\omega\\in S_{q}$ are the roots of \n\n\n$$P(x)=x^{d}-c_{1}x^{d-1}+c_{2}x^{d-2}-\\cdots\\pm c_{d},$$\n\nso that $c_{k}$ is their k-th elementary symmetric polynomial and $d=\\phi(q)=(p-1)p^{r-1}$ Additionally denote \n\n\n\n$$S_{n}=\\sum_{\\omega\\in S_{q}}\\frac{1}{(1-\\omega)^{n}}.$$\n\nThen, by Newton's identities,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}&S_{1}=c_{1},\\\\&S_{2}=c_{1}S_{1}-2c_{2},\\\\&S_{3}=c_{1}S_{2}-c_{2}S_{1}+3c_{3},\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nand so on. The general pattern when $n\\leq d$ is \n\n$$S_{n}=\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}(-1)^{j+1}c_{j}S_{n-j}\\right]+(-1)^{n+1}n c_{n}.$$\n\nAfter that, when $n>d.$ , the pattern changes to \n\n$$S_{n}=\\sum_{j=1}^{d}(-1)^{j+1}c_{j}S_{n-j}.$$\n\nLemma \n\nAll of the $c_{i}$ are integers except for $c_{d}$ . Furthermore,$c_{d}$ is $1/p$ times an integer.Proof. The qth cyclotomic polynomial is \n\n\n$$\\Phi_{q}(x)=1+x^{p^{r-1}}+x^{2p^{r-1}}+\\cdots+x^{(p-1)p^{r-1}}.$$\n\nThe polynomial \n\n$$Q(x)=1+(1+x)^{p^{r-1}}+(1+x)^{2p^{r-1}}+\\cdots+(1+x)^{(p-1)p^{r-1}}$$\n\nhas roots $\\omega-1$ for $\\omega\\in S_{q}$ ,so it is equal to $p(-x)^{d}P(-1/x)$ by comparing constant coefficients. Comparing the remaining coefficients, we find that $c_{n}$ is $1/p$ times the $x^{n}$ coeffiicient of $Q$ .\n\n\n\nSince $(x+y)^{p}\\equiv x^{p}+y^{p}$ (mod p), we conclude that, modulo $p$ ,\n\n$$\\begin{align*}Q(x)&\\equiv1+\\left(1+x^{p^{r-1}}\\right)+\\left(1+x^{p^{r-1}}\\right)^2+\\cdots+\\left(1+x^{p^{r-1}}\\right)^{p-1}\\\\&\\equiv\\Big[\\big(1+x^{p^{r-1}}\\big)^p-1\\Big]/x^{p^{r-1}}.\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $\\binom{p}{j}$ is a multiple of p when $0<j<p$ ,it follows that all coefficients of $Q(x)$ are multiples\"of $p$ save for the leading one. Therefore,$c_{n}$ is an integer when $n<d$ ,while $c_{d}$ ,is $1/p$ .times an integer.\n\n\n\nBy the recurrences above,$S_{n}$ is an integer for $n<d.$ . When $r=1$ , we get that $d c_{d}$ is not an integer, so $S_{d}$ is not an integer, either. Thus the answer for $r=1{\\mathrm{~i s~}}n=p-1$ Suppose now that $r\\geq2$ . Then $d c_{d}$ does become an integer, so $S_{d}$ is an integer as wel.\n\n## Lemma \n\nFor all n with $1\\leq n\\leq d.$ ,we have $\\nu_{p}(n c_{n})\\geq r-2$ .Furthermore, the smallest n such that $\\nu_{p}(n c_{n})=r-2{\\mathrm{~i s~}}d-p^{r-1}+1$ \n\n\n\nProof. The value of $n c_{n}{\\mathrm{~i s~}}1/p$ times the coeff icient of $x^{n-1}$ in the derivative $Q^{\\prime}(x)$ 1. This derivative is \n\n\n$$p^{r-1}(1+x)^{p^{r-1}-1}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}k(1+x)^{(k-1)p^{r-1}}\\right].$$\n\nWhat we want to prove reduces to showing that all coefficients of the polynomial in the square brackets are multiples of p except for the leading one.\n\nUsing the same trick $(x+y)^{p}\\equiv x^{p}+y^{p}$ (mod $p)$ as before and also writing w for $x^{p^{r-1}}$ modulo p the polynomial in the square brackets becomes \n\n$$1+2(1+w)+3(1+w)^2+\\cdots+(p-1)(1+w)^{p-2}.$$\n\nThis is the derivative of \n\n$$1+(1+w)+(1+w)^2+\\cdots+(1+w)^{p-1}=[(1+w)^p-1]/w$$\n\nand so, since $\\binom{p}{j}$ is a multiple of p when $0<j<p$ , we are done.\n\n□\n\nFinally, we finish the problem with the following claim.\n\nClaim— Let $m=d-p^{r-1}$ . Then for all $k\\geq0{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}1\\leq j\\leq d,$ we have \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\\nu_{p}(S_{kd+m+1})&=r-2-k\\\\\\nu_{p}(S_{kd+m+j})&\\geq r-2-k.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nProof. First,$S_{1},S_{2},\\ldots,S_{m}$ are all divisible by $p^{r-1}$ by Newton's identities and the second lemma. Then $\\nu_{p}(S_{m+1})=r-2$ because \n\n\n\n$$\\nu_{p}((m+1)c_{m+1})=r-2,$$\n\nand all other terms in the recurrence relation are divisible by.$p^{r-1}$ .We can similarly check that $\\nu_{p}(S_{n})\\geq r-2$ for $m+1\\leq n\\leq d$ . Newton's identities combined with the first lemma now imply the following for $n>d;$\n\n\n\n$\\bullet\\mathrm{~I f~}\\nu_{p}(S_{n-j})\\geq\\ell\\mathrm{~f o r~a l l~}1\\leq j\\leq d\\mathrm{~a n d~}\\nu_{p}(S_{n-d})\\geq\\ell+1,\\mathrm{~t h e n~}\\nu_{p}(S_{n})\\geq\\ell.$$\n\n$\\bullet{\\mathrm{~I f~}}\\nu_{p}(S_{n-j})\\geq\\ell{\\mathrm{~f o r~a l l~}}1\\leq j\\leq d{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}\\nu_{p}(S_{n-d})=\\ell,{\\mathrm{~t h e n~}}\\nu_{p}(S_{n})=\\ell-1.$$\n\nTogether, these prove the claim by induction.\n\n厂\n\nBy the claim, the smallest n for which $\\nu_{p}(S_{n})<0$ (equivalent to $S_{n}$ not being an integer, by the recurrences) is \n\n\n$$n=(r-1)d+m+1=((p-1)r-1)p^{r-1}+1.$$\n\nRemark. The original proposal was the following more general version:\n\nLet n be an integer with prime power factorization $q_{1}\\cdots q_{m}$ . Let $S_{n}$ denote the set of primitive nth roots of unity.

Assuming all collisions are elastic, find the minimum distance between the block and the wall by explicitly analyzing each collision. (Note that it does not suffice to just use the adiabatic theorem, because it applies to slow change, while the collisions are sharp. Nonetheless, you should find a quantity that is approximately conserved after many collisions have occurred.)",

      "text": "Let the speeds of the block and puck be v and w. Every collision, w increases by 2v.If the block is a distance x from the wall, then a collision happens in time $2x/w$ .Therefore,we have \n\n$$\frac{\\Delta w}{\\Delta x}=\frac{2v}{-2x v/w}=-\frac{w}{x}.$$\n\nBecause $m\\ll M$ , many collisions happen. After many collisions have happened, w will be very large, so in the next collision, ∆x will be small compared to $x$ , and $\\Delta w$ will be small \n\ncompared to w. In this case, we can approximate the finite differences with a derivative,giving \n\n$${\frac{d w}{d x}}\\approx-{\frac{w}{x}}.$$\n\nSeparating and integrating shows that wx is conserved. We could also have arrived at this by the adiabatic theorem,\n\n$$I=\\oint p d x=m w{\big(}2x{\big)}\\propto w x.$$\n\nHowever, in the earlier collisions $(\\Delta w)/w$ and $(\\Delta x)/x$ aren't small, so this reasoning is invalid.For instance, wx is zero before the first collision and nonzero right after it. Thus, we must treat the first few collisions manually. Right before the second collision, we have \n\n$$w\\approx2v_{0},\\quad x\\approx L/3$$\n\nby one-dimensional kinematics. Right before the third collision we have \n\n$$w\\approx4v_{0},\\quad x\\approx L/5 v w\\approx4v_{0},\\quad x\\approx L/5$$\n\nwhere for these early few collisions we are treating v as constant since $m\\ll M$ . It is not hard to show that right before collision $n+1$ , we have $w\\approx2n v_{0}$ and $x\\approx L/(2n+1)$ , which means that after many (but not too many collisions) we have $w x\\approx L v_{0}$ j. Then, for future collisions,wx stays at this value.\n\nThe block turns around when the puck has all its energy, so \n\n$$\frac{1}{2}M v_{0}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m w^{2}.$$\n\nPlugging in $w x=L v_{0}$ and solving for x gives the solution,$x=L{\\sqrt{m/M}}$.",

We'd like a model of skill-biased technical change with implications that we can test to check this story. Consider an economy in which aggregate manufacturing output is given by \n$$Y=\\left((K^{\theta}+L^{\theta})^{1/\theta}\right)^{\\alpha}H^{1-\\alpha}$$\nfor $\theta\\leq1\\quad{a n d}\\quad\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ . Here H and L are the aggregate supply of high- and low-skilled labor, respectively,and K is the aggregate stock of machinery that automates certain manufacturing tasks. Assume H and L are supplied inelastically. K is supplied perfectly elastically at rental rate r. Defining $\\omega\\equiv r K/\\alpha Y$ as capital's share of the K and L share of production, derive an expression for how ln K responds to changes in ln H and ln L.",

      "text": "Recall also that the ansatz is \n\n$$d s^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{h(y)}}\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}d x^{\\mu}d x^{\\nu}+\\sqrt{h(y)}\\delta_{a b}d y^{a}d y^{b}.$$\nLuckily we already worked out the curvature, once we make the substitution $H^{2}=\\sqrt{h},n=6,d=3$ in the formulas (11) and (12):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{R_{\\mu\\nu}}&{{}=\\frac{\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}}{4h}\\left[\\frac{\\Box h}{h}-\\frac{(\\partial h)^{2}}{h^{2}}\\right]}\\\\ {R_{a b}}&{{}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial_{a}h\\partial_{b}h}{h^{2}}+\\frac{\\delta_{a b}}{4}\\left(\\frac{(\\partial h)^{2}}{h^{2}}-\\frac{\\Box h}{h}\\right)}\\end{aligned}$$\nWe now proceed in direct analogy to what we did above. Taking the trace we find $\begin{array}{r}{R=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\square h}{h}=0}\\end{array}$ ,implying that h is harmonic on the transverse space. We should check that the Maxwell equations for the five-form are satisfied. These equations are just \n\n$$\\partial_{M}(\\sqrt{-g}F^{M N O P Q})=0$$\nOur ansatz for F is \n\n$$F=b(1+\\star)\\;d t\\wedge d x\\wedge d y\\wedge d z\\wedge d(h^{-1})$$\nwhich satisfies $\begin{array}{r}{F_{t x y z a}=-\\frac{b}{h^{2}}\\partial_{a}h}\\end{array}$ .Plugging this into the equation above and using $g^{\\mu\\nu}=\\sqrt{h}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu},g^{a b}=1/\\sqrt{h}\\delta^{a b}$ ${\\sqrt{-g}}={\\sqrt{h}}$ , we get \n\n$$\\partial_{a}\\left[\\sqrt{h}(\\sqrt{h})^{4}(\\sqrt{h})^{-1}F_{t x y z a}\\right]=-b\\partial_{a}\\left[h^{2}\\frac{\\partial_{a}h}{h^{2}}\\right]=0,$$\nimplying yet again that the Maxwell equation is satisfied iff h is harmonic. By now you probably believe me that this is a solution, but we should conscientiously check that all of the other components of the Einstein equations are satisfied. If we skipped this step, not only would we not have the pleasure of contracting $F^{5}$ with itself in entertaining ways, but we would also not be able to fix the value of b.\n\n\nSo we compute the right-hand side of the Einstein equation,$F_{M\\ldots}F_{N}^{\\ldots}$ . The easy one first:\n\n$$F_{\\mu\\ldots}F_{\\nu}^{\\ldots}=-4!b^{2}\\frac{(\\partial h)^{2}}{h^{3}}\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$$\nTo understand this, note that if we fix say the two indices t in $F_{t\\ldots}F_{t}^{\\ldots}$ ·and let all the rest vary, it is clear from the form (33) that to contribute the remaining indices must be a permutation of $\\{x,y,z,y^{a}\\}$ ·, where all a can contribute (I apologize for the bad notation; y with no superscript is one of the coordinates along the Poincare piece $x^{\\mu}$ $y^{a}$ with a superscript is a coordinate along the transvers space). There are 4! such permutations for each choice of with a superscript is a coordinate along the transvers space). There are 4! such permutations for each choice of $y^{a}$ resulting in the structure shown. Now the hard one, the computation of $F_{a\\ldots}F_{b}^{\\ldots}$ .To do this we first notethat \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{\\star(d t\\wedge d x\\wedge d y\\wedge d z\\wedge d y^{1})}&{{}\\equiv\\frac{1}{5!}\\epsilon_{\\phantom{t x y z y}M N O P Q}^{t x y z y^{1}}d x^{M}\\wedge d x^{N}\\wedge d x^{N}\\wedge d x^{O}\\wedge d x^{P}\\wedge d x^{Q}=}\\\\ {}&{{}=h^{2}d y^{2}\\wedge d y^{3}\\wedge d y^{4}\\wedge d y^{5}\\wedge d y^{6}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\nThus for example we see from (33) that $F_{23456}\\equiv F_{y^{2}y^{3}y^{4}y^{5}y^{6}}=-b\\partial_{1}h;$ ; if all the indices are $y^{a}\\mathrm{{'}s}$ , then the value of the component is the derivative of h with respect to the one y that isn't in the string. Now we are ready. There are two cases, start with $a\\neq b$ and take $a=1,b=2$ for concreteness. Then \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{F_{1\\dots\\cdot}F_{2}^{\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot}=F_{1\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}F_{2}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}+F_{1a b c d}F_{2}^{a b c d}}&{{}=4!\\left(-h^{2}F_{1t x y z}F_{2x y z t}+\\frac{1}{h^{2}}F_{13456}F_{23456}\\right)}\\\\ {}&{{}=-2.4!b^{2}\\frac{\\partial_{1}h\\partial_{2}h}{h^{2}}}\\end{aligned}$$\nThus for $\begin{array}{r}{a\\neq b,F_{a\\ldots.}F_{b}^{\\ldots.}=-2.4!b^{2}\\frac{\\partial_{a}h\\partial_{b}h}{h^{2}}}\\end{array}$ . Now the case $a=b=1$ ; going through an analogous computation we get \n\n$$F_{1\\dots.}F_{1}^{\\dots\\dots}=F_{1\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}F_{1}^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}+F_{1a b c d}F_{1}^{a b c d}=\\frac{4!b^{2}}{h^{2}}\\left(-\\partial_{1}h\\partial_{1}h+\\sum_{a\\neq1}\\partial_{a}h\\partial_{a}h\\right)$$\nWe can summarize these two relations in the combined form \n\n$$F_{a....}F_{b}^{....}=2.\\frac{4!b^{2}}{h^{2}}\\left(-\\partial_{a}h\\partial_{b}h+\\frac{\\delta_{a b}}{2}(\\partial h)^{2}\\right)$$\nComparing with (30) and the equation of motion (27), we see that the Einstein equations are satisfied if the value of b is fixed to be $b\\stackrel{\\cdot}{=}\\dot{\\pm}e^{-\\phi}/2$ . Hooray! Once again we see that we have a beautiful multi-center solution \n\n$$h(y)=1+\\sum_{i}\\frac{R_{i}^{4}}{|y-y^{i}|^{4}}$$\nwhere we can move the centers $y^{i}$ of the D3 branes wherever we like in the transverse 6-dimensional space and they will stay where we leave them due to the delicate yet strangely robust cancellation of the RR five-form field with gravity. As mentioned in lecture, this bizarre property manifests itself in the dual field theory description of this configuration-remember from lecture 6 that the $X^{i}$ in $\\mathcal{N}=4~\\mathrm{S Y M}$ parametrize movement in a 6N dimensional space along which the potential of the field theory is flat; there is no energy cost associated with changes in X. Now you know \"why\".\n\n\nFinally we restrict to one D3 brane in a spherically symmetric setup. Doing the integral $\\textstyle Q=\\int_{S^{5}}{\\star}F=2e^{-\\phi}R^{4}\\pi^{3}$ :we find that $R^{4}\\sim g_{s}Q$ ,where we have used $g_{s}=e^{\\phi}$ . Q is the RR charge, and is quantized in appropriate units.Essentially we have found that \n\n$$R^{4}\\sim l_{s}^{4}g_{s}N $$\nwhere $l_{s}$ is the string length scale and N is the integer number of RR flux quanta. This is the reason why AdS/CFT maps a classical gravity setup to a dual configuration with a larget'Hooft coupling-we need $g_{s}N=\\tilde{g_{Y M}^{2}N\\to\\infty}$ )to obtain a setup where R (the curvature scale of the solution) is much larger than $l_{s}$ and the classical supergravity solution can be trusted.",

      "text": "We show there are infinitely many beautiful integers. Here are three different approaches.\n\n One constructive approach. We will construct an increasing sequence of positive integers \n\n$$N_{4}<N_{5}<N_{6}<\\dots $$\n\nsuch that for every $k=4,5,\\ldots$ ,the number $N_{k}$ contains $2023_{b}$ in every base $4\\leq b\\leq k$ This will solve the problem because $N_{10000}$ 」,$N_{10001},..$ . will be the requested infinite set.For the base case, take $N_{4}=2023_{4}$ \n\n For the inductive step, here is one of many valid recipes. We are going to select \n\n$$N_{k}=N_{k-1}+c\\cdot(k\\ell)^{e}$$\n\nwhere the ingredients c, l, e are selected to satisfy:\n\n• l is the product of all primes at most k which are relatively prime to k (in particular,\n\n$\\operatorname*{g c d}(k,\\ell)=1)$ \n\n•e is large enough that for each $b=4,5,\\ldots,k$ , the largest power of b dividing $(k\\ell)^{e}$ is greater than $b\\cdot N_{k-1}$ .;\n\n• c is chosen to satisfy the modular congruence \n\n$$c\\cdot\\ell^{e}\\equiv2k^{3}+0k^{2}+2k+3{\\pmod{k^{4}}}$$\n\nwhich is possible since gcd $(k^{4},\\ell^{e})=1$ \n\nWith these ingredients, for all the smaller bases 4,$5,\\ldots,k-1$ , the ending of $N_{k}$ in base-b is the same as in $N_{k-1}$ (since $(k\\ell)^{e}$ is a multiple of a large enough power of b). On the other hand, we've embedded $2023_{k}$ into the base-k representation of $N_{k-1}$ , because the coefficients of $k^{e+3},k^{e+2},k^{e+1}$ $k^{e}$ in the base-k representation are exactly $2,0,2,3$ \n\nRemark. The essential difficulty in this approach arises from the fact that different bases may share overlapping prime factors, so the Chinese Remainder Theorem does not immediately apply.(Indeed, the solution above does not use the Chinese remainder theorem at all.) To give a concrete example, if N is an integer whose base-6 representation contains a specific substring, then there are several restrictions on what possible base-9 representations it could have, which are serious enough to limit the control a student has, but not strong enough to \n\nactually determine any of the digits. That's why in the inductive proof, there is sort of a \"critical step” in which the common prime factors are factored out via $(k\\ell)^{\\epsilon}$ ,after which c is chosen via modular inverses once the common prime factors have been factored out.\n\n An indirect inductive approach. The goal of this approach is to construct a system of congruences of the form \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}&N\\equiv2023_{4}\\cdot4^{e_{4}}+t_{4}\\pmod{4^{e_{4}+4}}\\\\&N\\equiv2023_{5}\\cdot5^{e_{5}}+t_{5}\\pmod{5^{e_{5}+4}}\\\\&N\\equiv2023_{6}\\cdot6^{e_{6}}+t_{6}\\pmod{6^{e_{6}+4}}\\\\&\\quad\\vdots\\\\&N\\equiv2023_{10000}\\cdot10000^{e_{10000}}+t_{10000}\\pmod{10000^{e_{10000}+4}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhich has at least one simultaneous solution in $N$ , and where $0\\leq t_{b}<b^{e_{b}}$ . The equation involving $b^{e_{b}+4}$ will automatically ensure N has the desired substring $2023_{b}$ , so we concern ourselves only with ensuring the system of equations is consistent.\n\nIn order to do this, we will need a more general version of the Chinese remainder theorem to moduli that are not coprime:\n\nTheorem(GeneralizedChinese remainder theorem)\n\nFix integers a, b, m, n with m,$n>0$ . The equations \n\n$\\begin{aligned}&x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}\\\\&x\\equiv b\\pmod{n}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$ \n\nhave a simultaneous solution if and only if $a\\equiv b\\;\\left(\\bmod\\;\\gcd(m,n)\\right)$ . Moreover, if \nthere is a solution, that solution is unique modulo lcm $\\mathfrak{l}(m,n)$ \n\nRemark. The usual Chinese remainder theorem is the case where $\\operatorname*{g c d}(m,n)=1$ ,in which case $a\\equiv b$ (mod 1) is always true.\n\n We now proceed by induction, selecting the pairs $(t_{4},e_{4}),\\thinspace(t_{5},e_{5})$ , . . . in order. For the base case, it is enough to take $t_{4}=e_{4}=0$ \n\n Now suppose we have selected pairs up to $(t_{b-1},e_{b-1})$ for some b and it is time to select $(t_{b},e_{b})$ . The inductive hypothesis means that the previous equations up to base $b-1$ can be collated into a single equivalent equation \n\n$$N\\equiv C{\\pmod{L}}\\qquad{\\mathrm{w h e r e~}}L:=\\operatorname{l c m}\\left(4^{e_{4}+4},5^{e_{5}+4},\\ldots,(b-1)^{e_{b+1}+4}\\right).$$\n\nThe critical observation is that as long as $e_{b}$ is selected large enough so that \n\n$$b^{e_{b}}\\geq\\operatorname*{g c d}(L,b^{e_{b}+4})$$\n\nthen at least one of the choices of $t_{b}$ will satisfy \n\n$$2023_{b}\\cdot b^{e_{b}}+t_{b}\\equiv C\\pmod{\\operatorname*{g c d}(L,b^{e_{b}+4})}$$\n\nwhich is the compatibility condition needed to ensure \n\n$$N\\equiv2023_{b}\\cdot b^{e_{b}}+t_{b}{\\pmod{b^{e_{b}+4}}}$$\n\ncan be added to the preceding equations. Since this is obviously possible (by taking $e_{b}>\\log_{b}L)$ the induction is complete.\n\n Density approach (outline). It's enough to prove the following claim:\n\nClaim— Fix any integer $b\\geq4$ .The arithmetic density of nonnegative integers whose base-b representation does not contain $2023_{b}$ as a contiguous substring is zero.\n\nProof. Think about just the last 4n digits in base-, in n groups of 4. For every complete residue class modulo $b^{4n}$ ,the number of base-b numbers that don't have $2023_{b}$ in their base-b representation is at most $(b^{4}-1)^{n}$ \n\n Consequently, if we have a threshold $N$ , the number of $2023_{b}$ -avoiding numbers in $\\{0,1,\\ldots,N\\}$ is bounded above by \n\n$$(b^{4}-1)^{n}\\cdot\\left\\lceil{\\frac{N}{b^{4n}}}\\right\\rceil+b^{4n}$$\n\nand so the density of $2023_{b}$ -avoiding numbers, for large $N$ , is at most \n\n$${\\frac{(b^{4}-1)^{n}}{b^{4n}}}=\\left(1-{\\frac{1}{b^{4}}}\\right)^{n}.$$\n\nSince this statement has to hold for any $n\\geq1$ , the density must be zero.\n\n□\n\nThus, it follows that \"most\" positive integers are beautiful!",

The main crux of the other direction is to consider \n\n$$M:=a b+1.$$\n\nRemark (Motivation). The reason to consider the number is the same technique used in IMO 2005/4, namely the idea to consider $ ``n=-1''$ The point is that the two rational numbers \n\n$$\\frac{1}{a}+b=\\frac{ab+1}{b},\\qquad\\frac{1}{b}+a=\\frac{ab+1}{a}$$\nhave a large common factor: we could write $ ``x_{-1}=ab+1''$ , loosely speaking.\n\nNow, the sequence is really only defined for $n\\geq1$ ., so one should instead take $n\\equiv-1$ $(mod\\varphi(M))$—$ and this is exactly what we do.\n\n\n\nObviously g($\\operatorname{c d}(a,M)=\\operatorname*{g c d}(b,M)=1$ .. Let n be a sufficiently large multiple of $\\varphi(M)$ SO that \n\n$$x_{n-1}=x_{n}=x_{n+1}=\\cdots.$$\n\nWe consider the first three terms; the first one is the $ \\text{\"key\"}$ one that gets the bulk of the work, and the rest is bookkeeping and extraction.\n\n\n\n• Consider $x_{n-1}$ _.

They vary in execution once some term of the form $x_{k\\varphi(n)-1}$ is taken, but avoiding the key idea altogether does not currently seem possible.\n\n\n\nA good example to consider for ruling out candidate ideas is $(a,b)=(18,9)$",

      "text": "When we take the limit as $\\beta\\rightarrow1$ ,the intuition is clear. The individual does not discount the future any more, he likes it as much as the present. So for him it does not make any difference in which order he gets the consumption levels and thus both paths of consumption give the same level of utility. Note that as we still have variability in consumption over time, the utility levels will depend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Algebraically, applying L'Hopital Rule,$\\scriptstyle\\operatorname*{l i m}_{\\beta\\to1}{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1-\\beta^{2}}}=\\operatorname*{l i m}_{\\beta\\to1}{\\frac{-1}{-2\\beta}}={\\frac{1}{2}}$ and then $$\\quad v_{0}=\\operatorname*{l i m}_{\\beta\\rightarrow1}v_{0h l}=\\operatorname*{l i m}_{\\beta\\rightarrow1}v_{0l h}=\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(c_{h}^{\\rho}+c_{l}^{\\rho})\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}...Q.E.D.$$ Using our equation for the welfare loss for $\\overline{{c}}=\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(c_{h}+c_{l})$ and $u_{0}\\:=\\:v_{0}$ obtained in 2 we get $$(1+\\eta)=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(c_{h}+c_{l})}{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(c_{h}^{\\rho}+c_{l}^{\\rho})\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}}.$$ Again the answer does not depend on α. Notice that if the individual has ∞ elasticity of intertemporal substitution $(\\rho\\to1)$ then there is no loss at all.This is reasonable since it does not matter to him that the consumption varies over time. And the less willing he is to substitute over time, the bigger the loss.",

So it makes sense to guess $f(1\\dots10)=98$ , and similarly guess \n\n$f(v)=98{\\mathrm{~w h e n e v e r~}}|v|=99$ \n\n\n\n• Now when we consider, say $v=1\\ldots100with|v|=98$ , we get \n\n$$f(1\\ldots100)+\\underbrace{f(1\\ldots101)}_{=98}+\\underbrace{f(1\\ldots110)}_{=98}+\\underbrace{f(1\\ldots111)}_{=100}\\equiv0\\pmod{98}.$$ \n\nwe obtain $f(1\\ldots100)\\equiv96\\pmod{98}$ . That makes $f(1\\ldots100)=96$ a reasonable guess.\n\n\n\nContinuing in this way gives the construction above.\n\n Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment $f,$ ,we will mold it into $f_{0}$ .\n\n\n\nWe define a push-down on v as the following operation:\n\n• Pick any v such that $|v|\\geq50{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}f(v)\\geq|v|$ \n\n• Decrease $f(v)$ by |v.\n\n• For every w such that $w\\subseteq v{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}|w|=|v|-1$ , increase $f(w)$ by 1.\n\nClaim— Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover,it doesn't change A unless $|v|=50$ ,where it decreases A by 50 instead.\n\nProof. The statement $P(u)$ is only affected when $u\\subseteq v{\\mathrm{:}}$ : to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of $P(u)$ decreases by $|v|$ , while $|v|-|u|$ terms increase by 1, for a net change of $[-|u|$ . So $P(u)$ !still holds.\n\n\n\nTo see A doesn't change for $|v|>50$ ,note $|v|$ terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by $-|v|$ . When $|v|=50,\\mathrm{o n l y}f(v)$ decreases by 50.□\n\nNow, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows:\n\n• First apply pushdowns on $1\\ldots1$ until $f(1\\ldots1)=100$ .\n\n• Then we may apply pushdowns on each v with $|v|=99\\mathrm{u n t i l}f(v)<99;$ \n\n•Then we may apply pushdowns on each v with $|v|=98\\mathrm{u n t i l}f(v)<98;$ \n\n• ...and so on, until we have $f(v)<50{\\mathrm{~f o r~}}|v|=50$ \n\nHence we get $f(1\\ldots1)=100and0\\leq f(v)<|v|for all50\\leq|v|\\leq100$ . However, by downwards induction on $|v|=99,98,\\ldots,50$ , we also have \n\n$$f(v)\\equiv f_{0}(v){\\pmod{|v|}}\\implies f(v)=f_{0}(v)$$ \n\nsince $f_{0}(v)$ and $f(v)$ are both strictly less than |v|.So in fact $f=f_{0}$ , and we're done.\n\nRemark. The fact that push-downs actually don't change A shows that the equality case we described is far from unique: in fact, we could have made nearly arbitrary sub-optimal decisions during the greedy algorithm and still ended up with an equality case. For a concrete example, the construction \n\n\n\n$$f(v)=\\begin{cases}{500}&{|v|=100}\\\\ {94}&{|v|=99}\\\\ {100-2|v|}&{50\\leq|v|\\leq98}\\\\ \\end{cases}$$ \n\nworks fine as well (where we arbitrarily chose 500 at the start, then used the greedy algorithm thereafter).",

Find an equilibrium where the search engine gets more revenue than in the sequential auction.",
      "images": []
    },
    "answer": {
      "text": "As I'm sure you all noticed, this question was quite hard! I will approach this question using the Generalized Second Price auction framework that we covered in class. Recall that in the GSP the highest bid gets the C1 slot but pays the per click price of the second bidder. The second bidder will receive the C2 spot and will pay the per click bid of the third bidder. Since there are only two bidders in this example, the lower bidder will pay a price of zero. To gain traction on the problem, we can first consider the utility of winning the C1 spot versus the C2 spot for each bidder as follows: $$\begin{aligned}{}&{{}U_{A}(C1|b_{B}=b)=C1(v_{A}-b)}\\ {}&{{}U_{A}(C2|b_{B}=b)=C2(v_{A})}\\ {}&{{}U_{B}(C1|b_{A}=b)=C1(v_{B}-b)}\\ {}&{{}U_{B}(C2|b_{A}=b)=C2(v_{B})}\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Setting the first two equations equal to one another gives us the price b that makes A indifferent from trying to stay in to win C1 or dropping out to win C2. Thus this is the highest bid A is willing to make in non-weakly dominated strategies. Similarly, setting the third and fourth equations equal gives the price b that makes B indifferent from trying to stay in to win C1 or dropping out to win C2. Thus, this is the highest bid B is willing to make in non-weakly dominated strategies. Hence, the most natural equilibrium to consider is, for $i=\\mathrm{A}$ .,B: $$b*(v_{i})=v_{i}(1-(C2/C1))$$ This equilibrium will raise total revenue equal to the number of clicks (C1) times the bid of the lower bidder, hence: $${~\\operatorname{R e v e n u e}~}=C1(v_{B}(1-(C2/C1)))=v_{B}(C1-C2)$$ Afew interesting notes: First,notice that if $\\mathrm{C2}=0$ ,ie. that slot C2 is worthless, than bidders are just bidding their valuation as they would in a standard second price auction. Second, notice that if $\\mathrm{C2=C1}$ ., so that slots are identical then the search engine gets O revenue as in part a. Third, many students tried to use an adaptation of the first price auction to solve this problem, which is absolutely fine since it was unspecified in the question. However, the Generalized First Price auction, where the high bidder gets C1 and the second highest bidder gets C2, and both pay their bids is quite difficult to solve in this case. The reason for this is that, as we discussed in recitation, the GFP auction actually doesn?t have any pure strategy Nash equilibrium. For example, consider a proposed equilibrium with some $b_{A}>b_{B}>0$ ,so that A wins the C1 slot and B the C2 slot. Then B would prefer to deviate to 0. He still would get the C2 slot but would pay less. But then A would prefer to deviate to . This would allow him to win the first object but pay less as well. But then, B would prefer to deviate to 2 and take the better slot! This overcutting continues back and forth until the bids are high enough so that bidder B will again prefer to deviate back to zero accepting the C2 slot rather than fighting for the C1 slot. This cycle persists indefinitely! Lastly, while the problem asks you to find only one equilibrium that raised more revenue than in Question 3, Part a, there are many more equilibria that use weakly dominated strategies that you could have solved for. To characterize this set we appeal to the same logic above, except using inequalities,because the players are actually indifferent over many strategies (since by nature of the GSP you end up paying a price based on the other player's bid). Then any pair of bidding strategies such that the following three conditions hold simultaneously is actually a Nash Equilibrium: $$\begin{aligned}{}&{{}b_{A}>v_{B}(1-(C2/C1))}\\ {}&{{}b_{B}<v_{A}(1-(C2/C1))}\\ {}&{{}b_{a}>b_{B}}\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Intuitively, the first equation says that bidder A bids high enough so that B doesn't want to overcut him to take slot C1. Similarly, the second equation says that bidder B bids low enough that bidder A won't undercut him to try to take C2. The third equation requires bidder A to bid more than Bidder B since you will notice that the right hand side of equation 1 is actually less than the right hand side of equation 2. Finally, these equilibria will raise revenues equal to anywhere from [0,$v_{A}(C1-C2)]$ depending crucially on the behavior of bidder B, since his bid determines the amount bidder A will actually be forced to pay.",

      "text": "Solution 1: We find a general formula for $\\frac{a(k,4n)}{a(k^{2},2n)}$ Let $P_{1}P_{2}\\ldots P_{4n}$ bethe k-Perfect 4n-gon. Consider the 2n-gon $P_{1}P_{3}\\ldots P_{4n-1}$ , obtained by taking every other vertex starting with $P_{1}$ For any $i,1\\leq i\\leq2n-2,\\triangle P_{1}P_{2}P_{3}\\sim\\triangle P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}$ with a ratio of $k^{i-1}:1$ .Therefore,$P_{i}P_{i+2}=k^{i}P_{1}P_{3}$ for any such i. Similarly, for i with $2n\\leq i\\leq4n-2$ , we have $P_{i}P_{i+2}=k^{i-2n+1}P_{1}P_{3}$ . So, we conclude that $P_{1}P_{3}\\ldots P_{4n-1}$ is similar to the $k^{2}\\text{-}P e r\\mathit{f e c t}$ 2n-gon,by a ratio of $P_{1}P_{3}:1$ By the Law of Cosines, $$P_{1}P_{3}={\\sqrt{1^{2}+k^{2}-2\\cdot1\\cdot k\\cos\\left(\\pi-{\\frac{2\\pi}{4n}}\\right)}}={\\sqrt{1+k^{2}+2k\\cos\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{2n}}\\right)}}.$$ Therefore, the area of $P_{1}P_{3}\\ldots P_{4n-1}$ is $$\\left(1+k^{2}+2k\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n}\\right)\\right)a(k^{2},2n).$$ If we remove this 2n-gon from our larger 4n-gon, we are left with 2n similar triangles. Each has an angle of $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2n}}\\end{array}$ with incident edges in a ratio of $1:k$ . For each $i\\in\\{0,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ ,there are two such triangles where the edges incident have lengths $k^{2i}$ and $k^{2i+1}$ . We want to relate the sum of the areas of these triangles to $a(k^{2},2n)$ somehow. Let A be a point in the plane, and construct rays $\\overrightarrow{A{{B}_{0}}},\\overrightarrow{A{{B}_{1}}},\\overrightarrow{A{{B}_{2}}},\\ldots,\\overrightarrow{A{{B}_{n}}}$ all emanating from A such that $\\overrightarrow{AB_{i}}is\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ radians clockwise with respect to $\\overrightarrow{A B_{i-1}}$ . Note that this makes points $B_{0}$ ,$B_{n}$ , and A collinear. Now, for each $i\\in\\{0,\\ldots,n\\}$ , let $C_{i}$ be the point on $\\overrightarrow{A B_{i}}$ that is $k^{2i}$ units from A. Consider the $n+1{\\mathrm{-g o n~}}C_{0}C_{1}\\ldots C_{n}$ . For each $i\\in\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\},\\triangle A C_{0}C_{1}\\sim\\triangle A C_{i}C_{i+1}$ with ratio $k^{2i}$ .This impliesthat $C_{i-1}C_{i}=k^{2i}C_{0}C_{1}$ .Moreover,the similar triangles also give us that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\angle C_{0}C_{1}C_{2}\\cong\\angle C_{i-1}C_{i}C_{i+1}=\\pi-m\\angle C_{0}A C_{1}=\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\end{array}$ for any $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ . This is sufficient to demonstrate that $C_{0}C_{1}\\ldots C_{n}$ is similar to half of the $k^{2}\\operatorname{-}P e r f e c t2n\\operatorname{-g o n}$ ,with a ratio of $C_{0}C_{1}:1$ We can compute $C_{0}C_{1}$ also by the law of cosines, getting $$C_{0}C_{1}={\\sqrt{1^{2}+k^{4}-2\\cdot1\\cdot k^{2}\\cos\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\right)}}={\\sqrt{1+k^{4}-2k^{2}\\cos\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\right)}}.$$ Hence,$C_{0}C_{1}\\ldots C_{n}$ has area $$\\frac{1+k^{4}-2k^{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{2}\\cdot a(k^{2},2n).$$ Our construction of $C_{0}C_{1}\\ldots C_{n}$ can be thought of as assembling the polygon from the n triangles $C_{0}A C_{1},C_{1}A C_{2},\\ldots,C_{n-1}A C_{n}$ . These triangles are related to the ones left over from our 4n-gon.For every triangle with edges $k^{2i}$ and $k^{2i+1}$ meeting at an angle $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2n}}\\end{array}$ ,there is a triangle with edges $k^{2i}$ and $k^{\\widetilde{2}i+2}$ meeting at an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ . Since any triangle $A B C$ has area $\\frac{1}{2}$ ab sin $C.$ the ratio of the sum of areas of the triangles from the 4n-gon to the sum of the areas of the triangles we just created is $${\\frac{2\\sin\\left(\\pi-{\\frac{\\pi}{2n}}\\right)}{k\\sin\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\right)}}={\\frac{2\\sin\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{2n}}\\right)}{k\\sin\\left({\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\right)}}.$$ (recall that we had $2n$ triangles in the first set but n triangles in the second set, hence the factor of 2). Therefore, the total area in the triangles left over from the 4n-gon is $$\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n}\\right)\\left(1+k^{4}-2k^{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)}{k\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}\\cdot a(k^{2},2n).$$ Adding up, we get that $$\\frac{a(k,4n)}{a(k^{2},2n)}=1+k^{2}+2k\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n}\\right)+\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n}\\right)\\left(1+k^{4}-2k^{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)}{k\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}$$ Finally, we can plug in $k=2$ and $n=6$ . This gives us $$\\begin{aligned}5+&4\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)+\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\\left(17-8\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)}{2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)}\\\\&=\\left.5+4\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right.+\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\cdot\\left(17-4\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\\\&=\\boxed{5-\\frac{25}{4}\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{25}{4}\\sqrt{6}}.\\end{aligned}$$",

So maximum throughput will be R/X,where $X=\\min(N-1,F+2)$ Jas described above.",

If the necklace is released from rest, it will slide off the table. At some point, the hanging part of the necklace will begin to whip back and forth. What fraction of the necklace is on the table when this begins? (Hint: we are considering a pearl necklace with no empty string between adjacent pearls; as a result, all the pearls accelerate smoothly. To solve the problem, think about the vertical forces. There is an important related problem in M2.)",
      "images": []
    },
    "answer": {
      "text": "Solution. Physically, what happens is that a sizable force is needed to turn the pearls around when they reach the corner, to go from moving horizontally to vertically. At a certain critical velocity,tension will no longer be enough to do this, and the pearl necklace will jump off the corner. This will lead to the hanging part whipping back and forth. To see when this happens, consider the vertical forces on the pearl necklace. Suppose the necklace has mass M and a fraction x is hanging off the table. As we saw with a similar but static problem in M2, the normal force on the horizontal part of the table has to cancel the force of gravity acting on the part of the necklace on the table. This is because otherwise a piece of the horizontal part of the necklace would have an unbalanced vertical force, and would have to go into the table or jump off it, neither of which make sense. Thus, considering the vertical forces just gives $$\frac{d p_{y}}{d t}=x M g-N_{c,y}$$ where we take the downward direction as positive for convenience, and $N_{c,y}$ is the vertical part of the normal force acting at the corner of the table. (Recall from M2 that this is significant evn when the corner is small.) Since the pearl necklace is flexible, the process is elastic, so energy is conserved. Our strategy is to use energy conservation to find $d p_{y}/d t$ and use that to find $N_{c,y}$ . The necklace jumps off the corner when $N_{c,y}$ becomes zero. Taking the necklace to have length $L$ , energy conservation gives $$\frac{1}{2}M v^{2}=M x g L\frac{x}{2}-\frac{M g L}{8}\\implies v^{2}=g L(x^{2}-1/4)\\implies\\dot{x}=\\sqrt{g/L}\\sqrt{x^{2}-1/4}.$$ The acceleration is $$\\ddot{x}=\\sqrt{g/L}\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^2-1/4}}\\cdot2x\\dot{x}=\\sqrt{g/L}\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2-1/4}}\\sqrt{g/L}\\sqrt{x^2-1/4}=(g/L)x$$ which we also found using the generalized coordinate approach explained in problem 16. Thus, $$\frac{d p_{y}}{d t}=M L\frac{d}{d t}(x\\dot{x})=M L(x\\ddot{x}+\\dot{x}^{2})=M L((g/L)x^{2}+(g/L)(x^{2}-1/4))=M g(2x^{2}-1/4).$$ Setting $N_{c,y}$ to zero gives $$2x^{2}-1/4=x$$ for which the relevant root is $x=(1+{\\sqrt{3}})/4$ .At this point,the fraction on the table is $$1-x={\frac{3-{\\sqrt{3}}}{4}}.$$ This is barely less than $1/2$ , so the necklace jumps almost immediately! Ideal flexible ropes can have rather unintuitive behavior, and we will discuss them further in a problem in W1. By the way, you might have noticed that the necklace jumps precisely when its speed is equal to the wave speed $v=\\sqrt{T/(M/L)}$ at the corner; the explanation for this will also be found in W1.",

So we need to find the inverse Fourier Transform of \\(1/(\\omega^2+T^2)\\) and then apply the duality.\n\nLet \\(F(j\\omega) = \\frac{1}{j^2\\omega^2+T^2} = \\frac{1}{-\\omega^2+T^2}\\). This is a known Fourier transform pair if \\(1/(s^2+T^2)\\) is the Laplace transform. But we are working in Fourier domain.\n\nFrom the solution steps:\nLet's assume the duality relation applies where if \\(\\mathcal{F}[f(t)] = G(j\\omega)\\), then \\(\\mathcal{F}[G(t)] = 2\\pi f(-\\omega)\\). If we know the Fourier transform of \\(e^{-|t|T}\\) is \\(\\frac{2T}{T^2+\\omega^2}\\), then by duality: The Fourier transform of \\(\\frac{2T}{T^2+t^2}\\) is \\(2\\pi e^{-|-\\omega|T} = 2\\pi e^{-|\\omega|T}\\).\n\nTherefore, for \\(g(t)=\\frac{1}{t^{2}+T^{2}}\\):\n\\(g(-\\omega) = \\frac{1}{(-\\omega)^2 + T^2} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2 + T^2}\\)\n\nWe know that the Fourier Transform of \\(e^{-a|t|}\\) is \\(\\frac{2a}{a^2+\\omega^2}\\).\nLet \\(f(t) = e^{-|t|T}\\).

We take an $n\times n$ subgrid of unit squares (i.e.$P_{i,j}$ for $1\\leq i,j\\leq n)$ ,and compute a lower bound on the average of all possible quadrilaterals from this subgrid. Consider the average length of the \"top side\" of all possible quadrilaterals in this grid.Note that this is equal to: $$\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}P_{i,j}P_{i+1,j}\\geq\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}P_{1,j}P_{n,j}>\frac{n-2}{n-1}.$$ We can apply this bound to all four sides of the quadrilateral (the left, right, bottom, and top sides) to find that the average perimeter of all possible quadrilaterals is greater than $${\frac{4(n-2)}{n-1}}=4-{\frac{4}{n-1}}.$$ This means we can always find a quadrilateral whose perimeter is at least $\textstyle4-{\frac{4}{n-1}}$ .By taking sufficiently large n, this lower bound will exceed c.\nProof $c=4$ is possible. We'll place point $P_{i,j}$ at the coordinates $(f(i),f(j))$ for some function $f\\colon\\mathbb{Z}\to\\mathbb{R}$ . The perimeter of $P_{i,j}P_{i+1,j}P_{i+1,j+1}P_{i,j+1}$ is then $$2{\big(}|f(i+1)-f(i)|+|f(j+1)-f(j)|{\big)}.$$ Therefore we have a valid construction for $c=4$ if f satisfies $n<f(n)<n+1$ and $|f(n+1)-f(n)|<1$ for all n. This is achieved by $$f(n)=n+0.5+\begin{cases}{-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{10^{i}}}&{\\mathrm{i f~}n\\geq0,}\\ {\\sum_{i=1}^{-n}\frac{1}{10^{i}}}&{\\mathrm{i f~}n<0.}\\end{cases}$$ Let's check the conditions. The sum is bounded by $\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}{\frac{1}{10^{i}}}={\frac{1}{9}}$ in magnitude, so $n<f(n)<n+1$ . Furthermore, we can verify that $$f(n+1)-f(n)=1-\begin{cases}\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}&if n\\geq0,\\ \frac{1}{10^{-n}}&if n<0\\end{cases}<1.$$",

In order to avoid a complicated moment of inertia calculation, we will assume the cross section looks like a wheel with six equally spaced massless spokes and no rim, with all the mass on the axle. The pencil does not speed up indefinitely, but rather reaches a steady state. Explain why, and compute the speed the pencil's axis has immediately after each collision, in the steady state.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "Solution. (a) Each time the pencil rolls through an angle $\\pi/3$ , a new vertex of the pencil hits the plane. In this moment, that vertex suddenly becomes the new pivot point about which the pencil is rotated, which means energy is dissipated in an inelastic collision. This is the reason that the pencil reaches a steady state, instead of accelerating indefinitely. You can see this very nicely depicted in this video. Let the pencil's center of mass have speed $v_{i}$ just before an impact, and $v_{f}$ just after the impact. The impact involves a singular impact force at the new pivot point, which means angular momentum is conserved about that point. Thus, $$M v_{i}R\\cos60^{\\circ}=M v_{f}R $$ from which we conclude $$v_{f}={\\frac{v_{i}}{2}}.$$ In the steady state, the kinetic energy gained from rolling from one vertex to another balances the energy lost in the collision, so conserving energy immediately after a collision and immediately before a next one gives $$\\frac{1}{2}M v_{f}^{2}+M g R\\sin\\theta=\\frac{1}{2}M(2v_{f})^{2}一$$ from which we conclude $$\\boxed{v_{f}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2g R\\sin\\theta}{3}}}.$$ By the way, the original formulation of the question gave the pencil a moment of inertia $C M R^{2}$ about its center of mass. The solution with general $C$ is not much harder. Now the angular momentum conservation condition is $$M v_{i}R\\cos60^{\\circ}+C M R^{2}\\omega_{i}=(C+1)M R^{2}\\omega_{f}$$ where $\\omega_{i}=v_{i}/R$ and $\\omega_{f}=v_{f}/R$ . Thus, $$v_{f}=\\frac{2C+1}{C+1}\\frac{v_{i}}{2}.$$ Likewise, the energy balance equation for the steady state becomes $$\\frac{1}{2}M(C+1)v_{f}^{2}+MgR\\sin\\theta=\\frac{1}{2}M(C+1)(2v_{f})^{2}$$ from which we conclude $$v_{f}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2g R\\sin\\theta(C+1/2)^{2}}{(C+1)\\left((C+1)^{2}-(C+1/2)^{2}\\right)}}.$$",

So, it must be that types $\theta\\in$ $[1-q_{2}-q_{1},1-q_{2}]$ buy the used good,$\\underline{{\theta}}=1-q_{2}-q_{1}$ \nThe lower threshold type θ is indifferent between buying the old good and not buying, so \n$$\begin{aligned}{\\underline{{\theta}}s_{1}-p^{u}}&{{}=0}\\ {p^{u}=s_{1}(1-q_{1}-q_{2})}\\ \\end{aligned}$$ \nThreshold type θ is indifferent between purchasing the old good and purchasing the new good, so \n$$\bar{\theta}s_{1}-p^{u}=\bar{\theta}s_{2}-p_{2}\\Rightarrow p_{2}=p^{u}+\bar{\theta}(s_{2}-s_{1})$$ \n$$p_{2}=p^{u}+(1-q_{2})(s_{2}-s_{1})$$ \nIntuitively, the price the monopolist can charge for the new good in period 2 is the price of the used good plus the extra value of the new good over the old for the type $\bar{\theta}$ consumer. Combining (6) and (8),and simplifying gives \n$$p_{2}=s_{2}(1-q_{2})-s_{1}q_{1}$$ \nNow consider the first period. Because utility is increasing in $\theta$ ,there is a single threshold $\\hat{\theta}$ that separates those who buy and those who do not. Since there are $q_{1}$ units available in period 1 and $1-\\hat{\theta}$ consumers buy in period 1, we must have $1-\\hat{\theta}=q_{1}$ _, SO \n$$\\hat{\theta}=1-q_{1}$$ \nType $\\hat{\theta}$ is indifferent between buying today and not. Since he will sell the good at the end of period 1, this implies that \n$$\\hat{\theta}s_{1}-p_{1}+p^{u}=0$$ \n(The user cost for period 1 is $p_{1}-p^{u}.)$ 」Combining (6), (10) and (11)therefore gives \n$$p_{1}=2s_{1}(1-q_{1})-s_{1}q_{2}$$",

Or, if your problem involves comlicated processes occurring in time, it can be useful to think in “spacetime\", meaning to visualize the process on a space where time is one of the axes.

    "answer": {
      "text": "This is an application of two effects we studied: the Doppler effect and the beating. First, let's determine what frequencies would be heard by the captain of one of the boats. Let's denote the natural frequency of the horn $f_{0}=200\\:\\mathrm{H z}$ :. The captain and his own boat move with the same velocity, so the captain would observe the sound of his own horn at the same frequency $f_{1}=f_{0}$ The sound from the other boat, on the other hand,would be shifted in frequency. The detector (captain)is moving with velocity $v_{D}=V=5$ m/s toward the source of sound. At the same time, the source is moving with velocity $v_{S}=V=5$ m/s towards the boat. The general formula that describes the Doppler effect is the following: $$f_{\\mathrm{d e t e c t e d}}=f_{0}\\frac{v\\pm v_{D}}{v\\mp v_{S}}$$ The sign assignment is as follows. If the source (or detector) is moving along the direction of the wave, we pick the minus sign in the denominator (numerator).If the source (or detector) are moving opposite to the wave, we pick the plus sign. The other way to think about it is to remember this. If the source and the detector are moving toward each other, the detected frequency is higher than the original. If they are moving away from each other, the detected frequency is lower (this is similar to the red shift observed in the light from distant stars, which are moving away from us due to the expansion of the Universe). Putting this all in place, we get the frequency of the sound from the other boat: $$f_{2}=f_{0}\\left(1+2\\frac{V}{v}\\right)\\approx206\\;\\mathrm{H z}\\;.$$ His own boat's horn will be heard at the original frequency $f_{1}\\;=\\;f_{0}\\;=\\;200\\mathrm{H z}$ . The two waves will interfere, and the resulting sound would be a pitch of $f=0.5(f_{1}+f_{2})=203$ Hz modulated by beat $f r e.$ quency $f_{\\mathrm{b e a t}}=f_{2}-f_{1}=6\\:\\mathrm{H z}$",

Then from the miraculous identity $$c^{3}-b-c=(1-c^{2})(a b-c)+a(\\underbrace{b c^{2}-b-c}_{=c a-b})+(c a-b)$$ so we conclude gcd $\\mathrm{l}(a b-c,c a-b)=\\operatorname*{g c d}(a b-c,c^{3}-b-c)$ ,, in other words $$b c^{2}-b-c=c a-b=\\operatorname*{g c d}(a b-c,c a-b)=\\operatorname*{g c d}(a b-c,c^{3}-b-c).$$ We thus consider two more cases: − If $c^{3}-b-c\neq0$ then the above implies $|c^{3}-b-c|\\geq b c^{2}-b-c.{\\mathrm{~A s~}}b\\geq c>1$ ,we must actually have $b=c.$ ,thus $a=c^{2}-1$ .Finally $a b-c=c(c^{2}-2)$ is a power of 2, hence $b=c=2,\\mathrm{s o}a=3$ – In the second case, assume $c^{3}-b-c=0$ ,hence $c^{3}-c$ . From $b c-a=1$ we obtain $a=c^{4}-c^{2}-1$ , hence $$c a-b=c^{5}-2c^{3}=c^{3}(c^{2}-2)$$ is a power of 2, hence again $c=2$ . Thus $a=11$ and $b=6$ . This finishes all cases, so the proof is done.",

      "text": "The main part of the problem is to show all solutions are linear. As always, let $x=b/c$ $y=c/a,z=a/b$ (classical inequality trick). Then the problem becomes $$\\sum_{\\mathrm{c y c}}f\\left({\frac{b+c}{a}}\right)=1.$$ Let $\begin{array}{r}{f(t)=g(\frac{1}{t+1})}\\end{array}$ , equivalently $g(s)=f(1/s-1)$ 1. Thus $g\\colon(0,1)\to(0,1)$ which satisfies $\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{\\mathrm{c y c}}g\\left(\frac{a}{a+b+c}\right)=1}\\end{array}$ , or equivalently $${\boxed{g(a)+g(b)+g(c)=1}}\\qquad\forall a+b+c=1.$$ The rest of the solution is dedicated to solving this equivalent functional equation in g. It is a lot of technical details and I will only outline them (with apologies to the contestants who didn't have that luxury). Claim— The function g is linear. Proof. This takes several steps, all of which are technical. We begin by proving g is linear over $[1/8,3/8]$ • First, whenever $a+b\\leq1$ we have $$1-g(1-(a+b))=g(a)+g(b)=2g\\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right).$$ Hence g obeys Jensen's functional equation over $(0,1/2)$ 1. • Define $h\\colon[0,1]\\;\to\\;\\mathbb{R}$ by $\begin{array}{r}{h(t)\\;=\\;g(\frac{2t+1}{8})-(1-t)\\cdot g(1/8)-t\\cdot g(3/8)}\\end{array}$ ,then h satisfies Jensen's functional equation too over $[0,1]$ . We have also arranged that $h(0)=h(1)=0$ ,hence $h(1/2)=0$ as well. • Since $$h(t)=h(t)+h(1/2)=2h(t/2+1/4)=h(t+1/2)+h(0)=h(t+1/2)$$ for any $t<1/2$ ,we find h is periodic modulo $1/2$ . It follows one can extend $\\widetilde{h}$ $$\\widetilde{h}\\colon\\mathbb{R}\to\\mathbb{R}\\qquad\\mathrm{b y}\\qquad\\widetilde{h}(t)=h(t-\\lfloor t\rfloor)$$ and still satisfy Jensen's functional equation. Because $\\widetilde{h}(0)=0$ ,it's well-known this implies $\\widetilde{h}$ is additive (because $\\widetilde{h}(x+y)=2\\widetilde{h}\\left((x+y)/2\right)=\\widetilde{h}(x)+\\widetilde{h}(y)$ for any real numbers x to y). But $\\widetilde{h}$ is bounded below on [0, 1] since $g\\geq0$ , and since $\\widetilde{h}$ is also additive, it follows (well-known) that $\\widetilde{h}$ is linear. Thus h is the zero function.$\\mathrm{S o}$ , the function g is linear over $[1/8,3/8]$ ;thus we may write $g(x)=k x+\\ell,$ ,valid for $1/8\\leq x\\leq3/8$ 1 Since $3g(1/3)=1$ ,it follows $k+3\\ell=1$ For $0<x<1/8$ we have $g(x)=2g(0.15)-g(0.3-x)=2(0.15k+\\ell)-(k(0.3-x)+\\ell)=$ $k x+\\ell$ , so g is linear over $(0,3/8)$ as well. Finally, for $3/8<x<1$ ,we use the given equation $$1=g\\left(\frac{1-x}{2}\right)+g\\left(\frac{1-x}{2}\right)+g(x)\\implies g(x)=1-2\\left(k\\cdot\frac{1-x}{2}+\\ell\right)=kx+\\ell.$$ since $\textstyle{\frac{1-x}{2}}<{\frac{5}{16}}<{\frac{3}{8}}$ . Thus g is linear over all. □ Putting this back in, we deduce that $\begin{array}{r}{g(x)=k x+\frac{1-k}{3}}\\end{array}$ for some $k\\in[-1/2,1]$ ,and so $$f(x)={\frac{k}{x+1}}+{\frac{1-k}{3}}$$ for some $k\\in[-1/2,1]$ . All such functions work.",

The shell is placed inside a fixed spherical bowl of radius R, and performs small oscillations about the bottom. Assume that friction between the bowl and shell is very large,so the shell essentially always rolls without slipping. The ball is made of an unusual material: it can quickly transition between a liquid and solid state. When the ball is in the liquid state, it has no viscosity, and hence no friction with the shell.When the ball is in the solid state, it rotates with the shell. Find the period of the oscillations if the ball is always in the solid state.",

The polarization is related to the total electric field by $$\\mathbf{P}=\\epsilon_{0}\\chi_{e}\\mathbf{E},\\quad\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{0}(1+\\chi_{e})=\\epsilon_{0}\\kappa $$ where $\\chi_{e}$ is the electric susceptibility and κ is the dielectric constant. The “free”charge density $\rho_{f}$ is the part of the charge density that isn't bound, so that $\rho=\rho_{b}+\rho_{f}.$ If we take the divergence of $\\mathbf{P}=\\epsilon_{0}\\chi_{e}\\mathbf{E}$ , we get $\rho_{b}=-\\chi_{e}\rho$ inside a uniform dielectric, so $\rho=\rho_{f}/\\kappa.$ A version of the method of images, introduced in E2, works for dielectrics.

So `y_L(x) = -3x-1`.\nFor `x \\in (1/2, 1]`, using `y(1)=1`: `y_R(1) = -3(1) + c_R = 1 \\Rightarrow c_R = 4`. So `y_R(x) = -3x+4`.\nThere is a jump discontinuity in the outer solution at `x=1/2`: `y_L(1/2) = -5/2` and `y_R(1/2) = 5/2`. This suggests an inner layer around `x=1/2`.\n\nInner solution:\nLet `X = (x-1/2)/\\varepsilon^\\alpha` and `Y(X) = y(x)`.\nSubstituting into the ODE: `\\varepsilon \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2\\alpha}} Y'' + Y(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^\\alpha}Y' + 3) = 0`\n`\\varepsilon^{1-2\\alpha} Y'' + \\varepsilon^{-\\alpha} Y Y' + 3Y = 0`\nTo balance the highest derivative term with the dominant nonlinear term, we equate their powers of `\\varepsilon`: `1-2\\alpha = -\\alpha \\Rightarrow \\alpha = 1`.\nSo the stretched variable is `X = (x-1/2)/\\varepsilon`.\nThe equation becomes `\\varepsilon^{-1} Y'' + \\varepsilon^{-1} Y Y' + 3Y = 0`.\nMultiplying by `\\varepsilon`: `Y'' + Y Y' + 3\\varepsilon Y = 0`.\nAt leading order `O(1)` (as `\\varepsilon \\to 0`):\n`Y'' + Y Y' = 0`\nIntegrate once: `Y' + \\frac{1}{2}Y^2 = a` (where `a` is an integration constant).\nRearranging: `Y' = a - \\frac{1}{2}Y^2`.\nThis is a separable ODE: `\\frac{dY}{a - \\frac{1}{2}Y^2} = dX`.\nIf `a>0`, the solution is `Y(X) = \\sqrt{2a} \\tanh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2}} X + b\\right)`.\n\nMatching the inner and outer solutions:\nAs `X \\to -\\infty` (i.e., `x \\to 1/2^-`), `Y(X) \\to -\\sqrt{2a}`. This must match `y_L(1/2) = -5/2`.\nSo, `-\\sqrt{2a} = -5/2 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{2a} = 5/2 \\Rightarrow 2a = 25/4 \\Rightarrow a = 25/8`.\nAs `X \\to +\\infty` (i.e., `x \\to 1/2^+`), `Y(X) \\to \\sqrt{2a}`.

It is not difficult to check that all of these f work, since if $n\\leq N,n f(f(n))=$ $n^{2}=f(n)^{2}$ ,and if $n>N,n f(f(n))=a^{2}n^{2}=f(n)^{2}$ First, say.$f(n)=a n$ for some positive integer n, such that $a n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ Then,$n f(f(n))\\;=\\;n f(a n)\\;=\\;f(n)^{2}\\;=\\;a^{2}n^{2}$ ,so $f(a n)\\;=\\;a(a n)$ It follows easily by induction that for all non-negative integers k,$f(a^{k}n)=$ $a^{k+1}n$ . In particular, an,$a^{2}n,\\ldots$ . are all integers, which implies that a itself is an integer, since if a prime p divides the denominator of a, when a is raised to a large enough power, the power of p can no longer divide n, making $a^{k}n$ non-integral for large enough k. Now, assume that $f(n_{1})\\;=\\;a n_{1}$ and $f(n_{2})\\;=\\;b n_{2}$ for some distinct positive integers $a,b>1$ Without loss of generality, say $a~<~b$ Choose a positive integer k such that $a^{k}n_{1}\\;>\\;n_{2}$ Then, we have  $f(a^{k}n_{1})=a^{k+1}n_{1}$ ,and $f(n_{2})=b n_{2}$ ,so that $a^{k+1}n_{1}>b n_{2}$ ,as f is strictly increasing. Applying  repeatedly to both sides, we find that $a^{k+e}n_{1}>b^{e}n_{2}$ for all integers $e>0$ ,but this is impossible for large enough e, as $b>a$ . Thus, we must have $a=b$ Thus, for some positive integer a, for all n, either $f(n)=n{\\mathrm{~o r~}}f(n)=$ an. Let n be an integer such that $f(n)=a n$ ,and $a>1$ . Then, assume we have some $m>n$ such that $f(m)=m$ .. For the unique k such that $a^{k}n\\leq m<a^{k+1}n$ ,note that.$f(a^{k}n)=a^{k+1}n$ . But since $m\\geq a^{k}n$ ,as f is increasing, we need $f(m)=m\\geq a^{k+1}n$ ,a contradiction. It follows that either $f(n)=a n$ for all n, or there exists a positive integer N such that $f(n)=n$ for all $n\\leq N$ and $f(n)=a n{\\mathrm{~f o r~}}n>N$ , as claimed.",

However, the solution to the system of equations will, indeed, depend on the signs of $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ (i.e., whether the images are inverted or not)\nThe table below shows the solutions to the system of equations for all 4 combinations of $m_{1}\\left(+\\mathbf{o r}\\right.$ -) and $m_{2}\\left(+\\mathrm{~o r~}\\overline{{\\phantom{\\dag}}}\\right)$ 1. The table reveals that, depending on the signs of $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ , the mirror may take on a concave or convex geometry for the initial and/or final object-to-mirror distances. As highlighted below, only the last combination of $m_{1}\\;(-0.5)$ and $m_{2}\\;(-1/3)$ conforms to the premise of the problem (i.e., that the ice-cream spoon is being used as a concave mirror).\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>Knowns</td><td>Solution to System of Equations (in centimeters)</td><td>Mirror Geometry</td></tr><tr><td>$d_{o}\\left(\\mathbf{c m}\\right)$</td><td>$\\mathbf{m_{1}}$</td><td>$m_{2}.$</td><td>S1</td><td>$S2$</td><td>S1</td><td>$s{2$</td><td>f</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>1/3</td><td>2.5</td><td>5</td><td>-1.25</td><td>-1.67</td><td>-2.5</td><td>Convex mirror for initial and final distances</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>-1/3</td><td>-0.5</td><td>2</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.5</td><td>Convex for initial; concave for final</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>-0.5</td><td>1/3</td><td>-1.5</td><td>1</td><td>-0.75</td><td>-0.33</td><td>-0.5</td><td>Concave for initial; convex for final</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>-0.5</td><td>-1/3</td><td>7.5</td><td>10</td><td>3.75</td><td>3.33</td><td>2.5</td><td>Concave for initial and final distances</td></tr></table>\nThe position (p) of the image, relative to the object, at each object-to-mirror distance is:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}p_{1}=s_{1}-s_{1}=7.5\\ cm-3.75\\ cm=3.75\\ cm\\\\p_{2}=s_{2}-s_{2}=10\\ cm-3.33\\ cm=6.67\\ cm\\end{array}$$\nThus, the answers to the specific questions are: When the spoon moved 2.5 cm $(\\mathrm{i.e.,~}s_{2}\\mathrm{~-~}s_{I})$ further awayfrom the object, the image \nmoved 2.92 cm $(\\mathrm{i.e.},p_{2}-p_{1})$ further away from the object.

The cylinder is free to rotate frictionlessly about the z-axis and it carries a uniform surface charge density $\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma=\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi R}}\\end{array}$ .

Eventually, when the external magnetic field is reduced to zero, the cylinder has a final angular velocity ω. You can assume that the final angular velocity is sufficiently slow such that relativistic effects can be ignored.

      "text": "We consider the pitch and heave dynamics of a large floating structure in a random sea. You can consider this a two-dimensional problem.\n\nThe structure has two main, identical struts that pierce the water: each has area $A_{w}$ of two hundred square meters, and their centers are separated by a distance L of fifty meters. The mass center of the structure is at the mid-point. The mass m is 1000 tons, and the mass moment of inertia about the centroid is $J=4.0\times10^{5}t o n\\cdot m^{2}$ . Each hull has an apparent linear damping in the vertical direction of $b=60k N\\cdot s/m$ \n\nThe horizontal motion of the structure is nearly zero. The vertical excitation force exerted at each of the struts may be approximated as the stiffness (provided by the strut's water-plane area) times $\\eta-\\zeta$ ,where η is the wave elevation at the location of the strut's center, and is the vertical displacement of the strut. Make linearizations where needed. Note we do not take into account any added mass forces in this problem. Also, we assume that the mass center is low on the water, so that the pitching moment is generated exactly by the net loss of flotation on one side and/or the increase of flotation on the other.\n\nFor the wave description, we use the Bretschneider spectrum; it is given by \n\n$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{S(\\omega)\\quad=\\quad\\displaystyle\frac{A}{\\omega^{5}}\\quad e^{-B/\\omega^{4}},\\quad\\mathrm{w h e r e}}}\\ {{\\omega_{m}\\quad=\\quad\\mathrm{m o d a l~(o r~p e a k)~f r e q u e n c y,~r a d/s}}}\\ {{B\\quad=\\quad1.25\\omega_{m}^{4};\\quad A=4B E_{S};\\quad E_{S}=H_{1/3}^{2}/16.}}\\end{array}$$\n\nIn SeaState 5, we take the modal period as 9.7 seconds, and the significant wave height $H_{1/3}$ as 3.3m. We assume that the waves are all traveling in the same direction, from negative x toward positive x.\nWhat are the significant heights (double amplitudes) of the heave and the pitch motions? Based on plots of the output spectra, about what are the dominant frequencies of these two motions?",

    "answer": {

The output spectra plots (attached) are interesting because the dominant frequency in the heave direction is close to the resonance, around 1.9rad/s, or 3.3seconds period. On the other hand, the pitch direction has a dominant frequency much lower, at about 0.75rad/s, or 8.4 seconds period - this is closer to the excitation frequency. You see that the effect of the different wavelengths gives rise to many peaks in the responses, and this ultimately controls the output spectra shapes.",

      "text": "A slinky is a uniform spring with negligible relaxed length, with mass m and spring constant k. Suppose a slinky's two ends are fixed, separated by distance $d,$ and rotating uniformly with angular frequency ω like a jump rope in zero gravity. Find the values of ω for which this motion is possible, and the shape of the slinky in this case.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "Solution. (b) The only difference with respect to part (a) is that now we have a radial \"gravity\" force of $g_{\\mathrm{e f f}}=-\\omega^{2}y$ ,because of the centrifugal acceleration in the frame rotating with the slinky.Therefore, $$y^{\\prime\\prime}=-{\frac{m\\omega^{2}}{k d^{2}}}y $$ The solution is a sinusoid. For concreteness, let's suppose one endpoint is at $x=0$ , imposing $y(0)=0$ . Then $$y(x)=y_{0}\\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\frac{\\omega}{d}x\right).$$ For the other endpoint to be fixd,$y(d)=0$ , we must have $${\\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}}\\omega=n\\pi.$$ If ω satisfies this condition for some n, then the slinky can rotate with uniform angular velocity,and its shape is a sinusoid. The value of $y_{0}$ is arbitrary. Another way to say this is that the solutions we have found here are standing waves. The valid values of ω, given the spring parameters, are just the standing wave frequencies. The fact that ω doesn't depend on d follows from dimensional analysis, and reflects the fact that stretching the string further increases the tension and decreases the density, therefore increasing the wave speed. These two effects cancel, keeping the standing wave frequencies the same. Note that so far we've considered three cases: a hanging rope (in the example), a hanging slinky,and a rotating slinky. So what about a rotating rope? Unfortunately, the differential equation describing it is $y^{\\prime\\prime}\\propto y\\sqrt{1+y^{\\prime2}}$ ,since the centrifugal acceleration is proportional to y. And unlike the example, this is a genuine nonlinear second order differential equation. Mathematica reports that the solution is not an elementary function, but rather an inverse elliptic integral. Unfortunately,that's just what happens most of the time.",

We first prove the following claim which reduces the problem to the study of monomials.\n\nLemma (Reduction to monomials)\n\nIf $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\\ldots$ . is stable, then each monomial $a_{0},a_{1}x,a_{2}x^{2},\\ldots\\mathrm{i s}$ \n\nstable.\n\nProof. For any $x\\in K$ , plug in $f(10^{e}x)$ for large enough e: the decimal representation of f will contain $a_{0},a_{1}x,a_{2}x^{2}$ with some zeros padded in between.\n\nLet's tackle the linear case next. Here is an ugly but economical proof.\n\nClaim (Linear classification) — If f(x) = cx is stable, then $c=10^{e}$ for some nonnegative integer e.\n\nProof. We will show when $c\\neq10^{e}$ then we can find $x\\in K$ such that cx starts with the digit 7. This can actually be done with the following explicit cases in terms of how c starts in decimal notation:\n\n• For 9 · 10e ≤ c < 10 · 10e, pick x = 8.\n\n• For 8 · 10e ≤ c < 9 · 10e, pick $x=88$ \n\n• For $7\\cdot10^{e}\\leq c<8\\cdot10^{e}$ ,pick $x=1$ \n\n• For 4.4 · 10e ≤ c < 7 ·10e, pick $11\\leq x\\leq16$ \n\n• For 2.7 ·10e ≤ c < 4.4 · 10c, pick 18 ≤ x ≤ 26.\n\n• For 2 · 10e ≤ c < 2.7 · 10e, pick 28 ≤ x ≤ 36.\n\n• For 1.6 · 10e ≤ c < 2 · 10, pick $38\\leq x\\leq46$ -−$38\\leq x\\leq46$ \n\n• For 1.3 · 10e ≤ c < 1.6 · 10e, pick 48 ≤ x ≤ 56.\n\n• For 1.1 · 10e ≤ c < 1.3 · 10c, pick 58 ≤ x ≤ 66.\n\n• For $1\\cdot10^{e}\\leq c<1.1\\cdot10^{e}$ , pick $x=699\\ldots9$ for suitably many c $9\\mathrm{{'s}}$ \n\nThe hardest part of the problem is the case where $\\deg f>1$ . We claim that no solutions exist then:\n\nClaim (Higher-degree classification)— No monomial of the form $f(x)=c x^{d}$ is stable for any $d>1$ \n\nProof. Note that $f(10x+3)$ is stable too. Thus \n\n$$f(10x+3)=3^{d}+10d\\cdot3^{d-1}x+100{\\binom{d}{2}}\\cdot3^{d-1}x^{2}+\\ldots $$\n\nis stable. By applying the lemma the linear monomial $10d\\cdot3^{d-1}x$ is stable, so $10d\\cdot3^{d-1}$ is a power of 10, which can only happen if $d=1$ \n\nThus the only nonconstant stable polynomials with nonnegative coefficients must be of the form $f(x)=10^{e}x+k{\\mathrm{~f o r~}}e\\geq0$ . It is straightforward to show we then need $k<10^{e}$ and this finishes the proof.\n\nRemark. The official solution replaces the proof for $f(x)=c x$ with Kronecker density.Here is how it goes.\n\nFrom $f(1)=c\\in K$ , we get $f(c)=c^{2}\\in K$ , et cetera and hence $c^{n}\\in K$ . However, I claim that when c is not a power of 10, some power of c starts with any specified prefix. For example, there should be an integer n such that $c^{n}$ starts with the digits 98765. And this is obviously a contradiction to $c^{n}\\in K$ \n\nTo see why, note this is equivalent to requiring that \n\n$$\\operatorname{l o g}_{10}(9.8765)\\leq\\{n\\operatorname{l o g}_{10}c\\}<\\operatorname{l o g}_{10}(9.8766)$$\n\nwhere $\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part of x. However, when c is not a power of 10,the number $\\log_{10}(c)$ is irrational. And Kronecker density theorem asserts that whenever α is irrational,the fractional parts {nα} for $n\\geq0$ are actually equally distributed across the entire open interval (0,1). In particular, there are n for which the fractional part lie in any interval of positive length.",

    "answer": {
      "text": "Again use the fact that the automorphism group G of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ over Q is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13)^{\times}$ by $a\rightarrow\\sigma_{a}$ where $\\sigma_{a}(\\zeta)=\\zeta^{a}$. The unique subgroup A of order 4 is generated by $\\mu=\\sigma_{5}$. From above, an element $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ fixed by A is of degree at most $|G|/|A|=12/4=3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, try symmetrizing/averaging itself over the subgroup A by $\\alpha=\\zeta+\\mu(\\zeta)+\\mu^{2}(\\zeta)+\\mu^{3}(\\zeta)=\\zeta+\\zeta^{5}+\\zeta^{12}+\\zeta^{8}$. The unique subgroup B of order 3 in G is generated by $\nu=\\sigma_{3}$. Thus, necessarily the coefficients of $(x-\\alpha)(x-\nu(\\alpha))(x-\nu^{2}(\\alpha))$ are in Q. Also, one can see directly (because the $\\zeta^{i}$ with $1\\leq i\\leq12$ are linearly independent over Q) that the images $\\alpha,\nu(\\alpha),\nu^{2}(\\alpha)$ are distinct, assuring that the cubic is irreducible over Q. To multiply out the cubic and determine the coefficients as rational numbers it is wise to be as economical as possible in the computation. Since we know a priori that the coefficients are rational, we need not drag along all the powers of ζ which appear, since there will necessarily be cancellation. Precisely, we compute in terms of the Q-basis $1,\\;\\zeta,\\;\\zeta^{2},\\;\\ldots,\\;\\zeta^{10},\\;\\zeta^{11}$. Given $\\zeta^{n}$ appearing in a sum, reduce the exponent n modulo 13. If the result is 0, add 1 to the sum. If the result is 12, add $-1$ to the sum, since $\\zeta^{12}=-(1+\\zeta+\\zeta^{2}+\\ldots+\\zeta^{11})$ express $\\zeta^{12}$ in terms of our basis. If the reduction mod 13 is anything else, drop that term (since we know it will cancel). And we can go through the monomial summand in lexicographic order. Using this bookkeeping strategy, the cubic is $\\left(x-(\\zeta+\\zeta^{5}+\\zeta^{12}+\\zeta^{8})\right)\\left(x-(\\zeta^{3}+\\zeta^{2}+\\zeta^{10}+\\zeta^{11})\right)\\left(x-(\\zeta^{9}+\\zeta^{6}+\\zeta^{4}+\\zeta^{7})\right)=x^{3}-(-1)x^{2}+(-4)x-(-1)=x^{3}+x^{2}-4x+1$. Yes, there are $3\\cdot4^{2}$ terms to sum for the coefficient of $x$, and $4^{3}$ for the constant term. Most give a contribution of 0 in our bookkeeping system, so the workload is not completely unreasonable. (A numerical computation offers a different sort of check.) Note that Eisenstein's criterion (and Gauss' lemma) gives another proof of the irreducibility, by replacing x by $x+4$ to obtain $x^{3}+13x^{2}+52x+65$ and noting that the prime 13 fits into the Eisenstein criterion here. This is yet another check on the computation. For the quartic, reverse the roles of $\\mu$ and ν above, so put $\beta=\\zeta+\nu(\\zeta)+\nu^{2}(\\zeta)=\\zeta+\\zeta^{3}+\\zeta^{9}$ and compute the coefficients of the quartic polynomial $(x-\beta)(x-\\mu(\beta))(x-\\mu^{2}(\beta))(x-\\mu^{3}(\beta)) = \\left(x-(\\zeta+\\zeta^{3}+\\zeta^{9})\right)\\left(x-(\\zeta^{5}+\\zeta^{2}+\\zeta^{6})\right)\\left(x-(\\zeta^{12}+\\zeta^{10}+\\zeta^{4})\right)\\left(x-(\\zeta^{8}+\\zeta^{11}+\\zeta^{7})\right)$. Use the same bookkeeping approach as earlier, to allow a running tally for each coefficient. The sum of the 4 triples is $-1$. For the other terms some writing-out seems necessary. For example, to compute the constant coefficient, we have the product $(\\zeta+\\zeta^{3}+\\zeta^{9})(\\zeta^{5}+\\zeta^{2}+\\zeta^{6})(\\zeta^{12}+\\zeta^{10}+\\zeta^{4})(\\zeta^{8}+\\zeta^{11}+\\zeta^{7})$ which would seem to involve 81 summands. We can lighten the burden by notating only the exponents which appear, rather than recopying zetas. Further, multiply the first two factors and the third and fourth, leaving a multiplication of two 9-term factors (again, retaining only the exponents) $\\left(6\\quad3\\quad7\\quad8\\quad5\\quad9\\quad1\\quad11\\quad2\right)\\left(7\\quad10\\quad6\\quad5\\quad8\\quad4\\quad12\\quad2\\quad11\right)$. As remarked above, a combination of an exponent from the first list of nine with an exponent from the second list will give a non-zero contribution only if the sum (reduced modulo 13) is either 0 or 12, contributing 1 or $-1$ respectively. For each element of the first list, we can keep a running tally of the contributions from each of the 9 elements from the second list. Thus, grouping by the elements of the first list, the contributions are, respectively, $(1-1)+(1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(-1+1)+(1)+(1-1)+(1)(-1+1)=3$. The third symmetric function is a sum of 4 terms, which we group into two, writing in the same style $\begin{array}{c}{\\left(\begin{matrix}{1}&{3}&{9}&{5}&{2}&{6}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)\\left(\begin{matrix}{7}&{10}&{6}&{5}&{8}&{4}&{12}&{2}&{11}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)}\\ {+\\left(\begin{matrix}{6}&{3}&{7}&{8}&{5}&{9}&{1}&{11}&{2}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)\\left(\begin{matrix}{12}&{10}&{4}&{8}&{11}&{7}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)}\\ \\end{array}$. In each of these two products, for each item in the lists of 9, we tally the contributions of the 6 items in the other list, obtaining, $(0+0-1+0+1+1+0+0)+(1+1+0-1+0+1+0+0+0)=4$. The computation of the second elementary symmetric function is, similarly, the sum $\begin{array}{r c c c c c}{\\left(\begin{matrix}{1}&{3}&{9}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)\\left(\begin{matrix}{5}&{2}&{6}&{12}&{10}&{4}&{8}&{11}&{7}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)}\\ {}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{}\\ {}&{+\\left(\begin{matrix}{5}&{2}&{6}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)\\left(\begin{matrix}{12}&{10}&{4}&{8}&{11}&{7}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)+\\left(\begin{matrix}{12}&{10}&{4}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)\\left(\begin{matrix}{8}&{11}&{7}\\ \\end{matrix}\right)}\\ \\end{array}$. Grouping the contributions for each element in the lists 1,3,9 and 5,2,6 and 12, 10,4, this gives $[(1-1)+(1)+(1)]+[(1-1)+(-1+1)+(1)]+[0+0+(-1)]=2$. Thus, in summary, we have $x^{4}+x^{3}+2x^{2}-4x+3$. Again, replacing x by $x+3$ gives $x^{4}+13x^{3}+65x^{2}+143x+117$. All the lower coefficients are divisible by 13, but not by $13^{2}$, so Eisenstein proves irreducibility. This again gives a sort of verification of the correctness of the numerical computation.",

This can be done by simply assuming that each player plays exit with probability $\\frac{1}{m}$ in the $m^{\\mathrm{t h}}$ strategy profile in the sequence, as in Problem 1.",

Notice that the before tax wage is higher than part 1, while the after tax wage is lower than in part 1. The tax makes labor more expensive, so firms have to be more willing to pay for labor (thus the before-tax wage goes up). But, the rise in productivity is less than one-for-one; on net, the after tax wage drops as a result of the tax. The new allocation of labor is given by $$\\begin{aligned}l^{*}\\ & =\\ b\\tilde{w}^{*}\\\\&=\\ b\\left(1-\\tau\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{K}}{b}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\\\&=\\ \\left(b\\left(1-\\tau\\right)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{K}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\end{aligned}$$ which is less than before (since labor is taxed). Finally, the competitive price of capital solves $$\\begin{aligned}r^{*}\\quad&=\\quad\\alpha\\left(\\frac{l^{*}}{\\bar{K}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\\\r^{*}\\quad&=\\quad\\alpha\\left(\\left(b\\left(1-\\tau\\right)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\frac{\\left(\\bar{K}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}}{\\bar{K}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\\\r^{*}\\quad&=\\quad\\alpha\\left(\\frac{b\\left(1-\\tau\\right)\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)}{\\bar{K}}\\right)^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\end{aligned}$$ so that $r^{*}$ is lower than in part 1. The tax on labor reduces the amount of labor supplied in equilibrium. This reduces the marginal product of capital (since capital and labor are complements in our production function), which thereby lowers the return on capital.",

      "text": "As in most discrete time formulations, this H2 optimization setuo has at least two different interpretations: the one in which only strictly causal controllers are allowed (i.e.$u[k]$ is allowed to depend on $y[k-1],y[k-1],\\dots)$ ,and the one with an arbitrary causal controller $(u[k]$ depends on $y[k],y[k\\mathrm{~-~}1],\\dots)$ . Below, a solution for the second case is presented. First, since there is an open loop pole at $z=-1$ , we introduce the new control variable $$v[k]=u[k]-y[k]=u[k]-x[k]-w_{2}[k].$$ The new system equations will have the form $$x[k+1]=w_{1}[k]+w_{2}[k]+v[k],z[k]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{a x[k]}\\\\ {x[k]+w_{2}[k]+v[k]}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],y[k]=x[k]+w_{2}[k].$$ Then, in order to reduce the problem to that of desining a strictly causal controller,introduce the new sensor output $$\\bar{y}[k]=y[k+1]=x[k+1]+w_{2}[k+1]=w_{1}[k]+w_{2}[k]+v[k]+w_{2}[k+1].$$ Since the equations now depend on both $w_{2}[k]$ and $w_{2}[k+1]$ _, we introduce an additional system state $x_{2}[k]=w_{2}[k]$ , and a modified noise vector $$f[k]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{f_{1}[k]}\\\\ {f_{2}[k]}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{w_{1}[k]}\\\\ {w_{2}[k+1]}\\end{array}\\right].$$ Now system equations have the form $$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}[k+1]}\\\\ {x_{2}[k+1]}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{2}[k]+f_{1}[k]+v[k]}\\\\ {f_{2}[k]}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],\\quad z[k]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{a x_{1}[k]}\\\\ {x_{1}[k]+x_{2}[k]+v[k]}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],\\quad\\bar{y}[k]=x_{2}[k]{+}f_{1}[k]{+}f_{2}[k]{+}v[k],$$ where $x_{1}[k]=x[k]$ . Here $D_{11}=0$ . To make sure that the transfer matrix from control to sensor is zero at $\\mathbf{z}=-1$ ,use $D_{22}=0$ 1, which means introducing a new sensor variable $$y_{*}[k]=\\bar{y}[k]-v[k]=x_{2}[k]+f_{1}[k]+f_{2}[k].$$ Now the open loop plant transfer matrix is $$P^{D T}(z)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c}{\\frac{a}{z}}&{\\frac{a}{z^{2}}}&{\\frac{a}{z}}\\\\ {\\frac{1}{z}}&{\\frac{z+1}{z^{2}}}&{\\frac{z+1}{z}}\\\\ {1}&{\\frac{z+1}{z}}&{0}\\end{array}\\right].$$ Applyin the Tustin transform $$z={\\frac{1+s}{1-s}},s={\\frac{z-1}{z+1}},$$ yields a continuous time plant $$P(s)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c}{a\\frac{1-s}{1+s}}&{a\\frac{(1-s)^{2}}{(1+s)^{2}}}&{a\\frac{1-s}{1+s}}\\\\ {\\frac{1-s}{1+s}}&{2\\frac{1-s}{(1+s)^{2}}}&{\\frac{2}{1+s}}\\\\ {1}&{\\frac{2}{1+s}}&{0}\\end{array}\\right].$$ After dividing $P_{f z}(s)$ by $1-s$ and multiplying $P_{v y}(s)$ by $1-s$ , we get $$\\hat{P}(s)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c}{\\frac{a}{1+s}}&{\\frac{a(1-s)}{(1+s)^{2}}}&{a\\frac{1-s}{1+s}}\\\\ {\\frac{1}{1+s}}&{\\frac{2}{(1+s)^{2}}}&{\\frac{2}{1+s}}\\\\ {1}&{\\frac{2}{1+s}}&{0}\\end{array}\\right].$$ A state space model of this CT plant is given by $$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\dot{x}_{1}(t)}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}(t)}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{-x_{1}(t)+2x_{2}(t)+f_{1}(t)+2v(t)}\\\\ {-x_{2}(t)+f_{2}(t)}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],\\:z(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{a(x_{1}(t)-x_{2}(t)-v(t))}\\\\ {x_{1}(t)}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],\\:y(t)=f_{1}(t){+}2x_{2}(t).$$ To solve the corresponding standard CT H2 optimization problem, consider the associated full information abstract H2 optimization: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{-x_{1}+2x_{2}+2u}\\\\ {-x_{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right],\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\{|x_{1}|^{2}+a^{2}|u+x_{2}-x_{1}|^{2}\\}d t\\to\\operatorname*{m i n}.$$ With a modified control vector $$\\tilde{u}=u+x_{2}-x_{1},$$ the problem can be re-written in an equivalent one-dimensional form $$\\dot{x}_{1}=x_{1}+2\\tilde{u},\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\{|x_{1}|^{2}+a^{2}|\\tilde{u}|^{2}\\}d t\\rightarrow\\operatorname*{m i n}.$$ The optimal controller is given by $$u=-g_{f}x_{1}-x_{2},$$ where $$g_{f}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{a^{2}}}-\\frac{1}{2}=1-\\frac{2p_{f}}{a^{2}},$$ and $$p_{f}={\\frac{a^{2}}{4}}+{\\sqrt{\\frac{a^{2}}{4}+{\\frac{a^{4}}{16}}}}.$$ is the stabilizing solution of the associated Riccati equation $$p^{2}-{\\frac{a^{2}}{2}}p-{\\frac{a^{2}}{4}}=0.$$ Similarly, consider the associated state estimation abstract H2 optimization: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\dot{\\psi}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{\\psi}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{-\\psi_{1}}\\\\ {2\\psi_{1}-\\psi_{2}+2q}\\end{array}\\right],\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\{|\\psi_{1}+q|^{2}+|\\psi_{2}|^{2}\\}d t\\rightarrow\\operatorname*{m i n}.$$ With a modified control vector $$\\tilde{q}=\\psi_{1}+q,$$ the problem can be re-written in an equivalent one-dimensional form $$\\dot{\\psi}_{2}=-\\psi_{2}+2\\tilde{q},\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\{|\\psi_{2}|^{2}+|\\tilde{q}|^{2}\\}d t\\rightarrow\\operatorname*{m i n}.$$ The optimal controller is given by $$q=-\\psi_{1}-g_{e}\\psi_{2},$$ where $$g_{e}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+1}-\\frac{1}{2}=2p_{e},$$ and $$p_{e}=-\\frac{1}{4}+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{16}}.$$ is the stabilizing solution of the associated Riccati equation $$p^{2}+{\\frac{1}{2}}p-{\\frac{1}{4}}=0.$$ The optimal CT controller $K^{C T}$ has state space model $$\\frac{d}{d t}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\hat{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\hat{x}_{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{-\\hat{x}_{1}+2\\hat{x}_{2}+2u}\\\\ {-\\hat{x}_{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{1}\\\\ {g_{e}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right](2\\hat{x}_{2}-y),u=-g_{f}\\hat{x}_{1}-\\hat{x}_{2},$$ which corresponds to controller transfer function $$K^{C T}(s)=-\\frac{g_{f}(s+1)+g_{e}(s+1+2g_{f})}{(s+1+2g_{f})(s+1+2g_{e})}.$$ The inverse Tustin transform ${\\hat{K}}(z)$ of $(1-s)K^{C T}(s)$ is given by $$\\hat{K}(z)=-\\frac{2z g_{f}+g_{e}(2z+g_{f}(z+1))}{(2z+g_{f}(z+1))(2z+g_{e}(z+1))}.$$ Due to the changes of control and sensor variables introduced in the original setup, the true optimal controller (with input $y[k]$ and output $u[k])$ is given by $$K(z)=1+\\frac{z\\hat{K}(z)}{1+\\hat{K}(z)},$$ which yields $$K(z)=\\frac{4z-g_{e}g_{f}}{(2+g_{e})(2+g_{f})z+g_{e}g_{f}}.$$",
