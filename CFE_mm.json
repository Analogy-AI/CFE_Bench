Along any axis, at least two coordinates are zero, this means that the first four constants in the general solution can be non-zero, but all the rest must be zero. But symmetry also restricts the solution. For the expanded form, you can readily convince yourselfthat $C_{2}=C_{3}=C_{4}=C$ . For the factored form, in order to require that $C_{5},C_{6}$ ,and $C_{7}$ are zero, we need that $DF=BF=BD=0$ . But symmetry in this case requires that the problem is invariant if the axes are permuted; as such,$A=C=E$ and $B=D=F$ '. In other words, symmetry means that Equation 4.34 can be written as \n\n$$\\Phi(x,y,z)=(A x+B)(A y+B)(A z+B)$$\n\nThen it follows that $B=D=F=0$ .

Then \n$$\\frac{N}{(N r+R)^{2}}=\\frac{N\\pm1}{(N r\\pm r+R)2}$$\nor \n$$N^{3}r^{2}+2N^{2}(R\\pm r)r+N(R\\pm r)^{2}=N^{3}r^{2}+2N^{2}R r+N R^{2}\\pm N^{2}r^{2}\\pm2N R r\\pm R^{2}.$$\nThankfully, we loose the cubic term \n$$\\pm2N^{2}r^{2}\\pm2N R r+N r^{2}=\\pm N^{2}r^{2}\\pm2N R r\\pm R^{2}.$$\nTo save space, flip the \\pmto the one term that doesn't have it.\n$$N^{2}r^{2}\\pm N r^{2}=R^{2}$$\nOnlypositive answers have meaning, so \n$$r=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N(N\\pm1)}}R.$$\nwhich give the correct bounds as \n$$\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{30}}\\leq r\\leq\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{20}}$$ \nIf you knew about geometric means, you might have been able to just write this down.",

      "text": "$${\\mathsf X}_{1}=-{\\mathsf L}$$ Figure 1: Diagram of surfaces (1), (2), (3), and (4) to evaluate the force on the lower plate using the Maxwell Stress Tensor. Before finding the force, we must calculate the H field at $x_{1}=L$ . To find this field let us use $$\\oint\\bar{B}\\cdot\\bar{n}d a=0$$ over the dotted surface. At $x_{1}=+L$ $$\\bar{H}(x_{1}=L)=H_{0}\\bar{i}_{1}$$ over surface (4)$\\bar{H}=0$ , and over surface (2), H is in the $\\overline{{i}}_{1}$ direction, where $\\bar{n}=\\bar{i}_{2}$ . Thus over surface (2),$\\bar{B}\\cdot\\bar{n}=0$ . Hence, the integral in (1) reduces to $$\\begin{aligned}{}&{{}-\\int_{(1)}\\mu_{0}H_{0}d a+\\int_{(3)}\\mu_{0}H(x_{1}=+L)d a=0}\\\\ {}\\&{{}-\\mu_{0}H_{0}a+\\mu_{0}H b=0\\qquad\\operatorname{p e r u i t l e n g t h}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Thus: $$\\begin{aligned}{}&{{}\\bar{H}(x_{1}=+L)=(a/b)H_{0}\\bar{i}_{1}}\\\\ {}\\&{{}T_{i j}=\\mu_{0}H_{i}H_{j}-\\frac{\\delta_{i j}}{2}\\mu_{0}H_{k}H_{k}}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Hence, the stress tensor over surfaces (1), (2), and (3) is: $$T_{i j}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c}{\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{1}^{2}}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{1}^{2}}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{-\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{1}^{2}}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$$ Over surface (4) $$T_{i j}=[0]$$ Thus the force in the 1 direction is $$\\begin{aligned}{f_{1}}&{{}=\\int T_{i j}n_{j}\\cdot d a}\\\\ {f_{1}}&{{}=-\\int_{(1)}T_{11}d a+\\int_{(3)}T_{11}d a+\\int_{(2)}T_{12}d a.}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Thus, since the last integral makes no contribution, $$f_{1}=-\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{0}^{2}(a)+\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{0}^{2}\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^{2}\\cdot b=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2}H_{0}^{2}a\\left(\\frac{a}{b}-1\\right)$$ Since $T_{i j}=0$ over surface (4) there is no contribution to the force from this surface and, by symmetry, there is no contribution to the force from the surfaces perpendicular to the $x_{j}$ axis.

      "text": "Again, the average of the control factor level means $(\\mathrm{e.g.,m_{A1},m_{A2},m_{A3}})$ for any control factor is always equal to the grand mean () for the experiment. This applies equally well to the means as it does to the S/N ratio if an additive model is assumed to hold. Looking at the factor effect plot for mean, the grand mean appears to be about 16.2 seconds.\n\nYou've already decided to set the factor levels A2, B1, D3 in order to increase the S/N ratio. Given these changes in control factor settings, the predicted mean is the grand mean plus the sum of the factor effects. From the factor effects plot, you can estimate the S/N ration as $16.2\\mathrm{sec}-1.2\\mathrm{sec}-1.5\\mathrm{sec}=13.5\\mathrm{sec}$ \n\nIn order to get back on target at 16 seconds, we should use the scaling factor to raise the mean time by 2.5 seconds. Setting C1 should get us most of the way back on target, but we may want to go to a slightly lower level of control factor C beyond the level we tested to get the product back on target.",

      "text": "In 1765, British clockmaker James Cox invented a clock whose only source of energy is the fluctuations in atmospheric pressure. Cox's clock used two vessels containing mercury. Changes in atmospheric pressure caused mercury to move between the vessels, and the two vessels to move relative to each other. This movement acted as an energy source for the actual clock.\n\nWe propose an analysis of this device. Throughout,we assume that\n•the Earth's gravitational field $\\overrightarrow{g}=-g\\overrightarrow{u_{z}}$ is uniform with $g=9.8\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\\overrightarrow{u_{z}}$ a unit vector;\n• all liquids are incompressible and their density is denoted $\\rho;$\n•no surface tension effects will be considered;\n•the variations of atmospheric pressure with altitude are neglected;\n•the surrounding temperature $T_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is uniform and all transformations are isothermal.\n\nThe real mechanism developed by Cox is complex (Fig. 5). We study a simplified version, depicted in Fig.6, and described below\n\n• a cylindrical bottom cistern containing a mercury bath ;\n\n•a two-part barometric tube identical to that studied in part B, which is still completely emptied of any air, is dipped into the bath ;\n\n• the cistern and the two-part tube are each suspended by a cable. Both cables (assumed to be inextensible and of negligible mass) pass through a system of ideal pullies and finish attached to either side of the same mass M, which can slide on a horizontal surface;\n\n•the total volume of liquid mercury contained in the system is $V_{\\ell}=5\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe height, cross-section and masses of each part are given in Table 2. The position of mass M is referenced by the coordinate x of its center of mass. We consider solid friction between the horizontal support and the mass M, without distinction between static and dynamic coefficients; the magnitude of this force when sliding occurs is denoted $F_{\\mathrm{s}}$\n\nTwo stops limit the displacement of the mass M such that $-X\\leq x\\leq X\\;(\\mathsf{w i t h}\\;X>0)$ 1.Assume that the value of X guarantees that\n\n•the bottom of the two-part tube never touches the bottom of the cistern nor comes out of the liquid bath;\n\n• the altitude $z_{\\ell}$ of the mercury column is always in the upper bulb.\n\n<image>\n\nFig.5.Real Cox's timepiece 2(without mercury)\n\n<image>\n\nFig. 6.

      "text": "Consider the case in which the mass M stays at rest at $x=0$ .At the start $t=0$ ,the tensions exerted by the two cables on either side of the mass M are in balance: the force $F_{0}$ required to suspend the barometric tube (with the fluid it contains) is equal to that required to suspend the cistern (with the fluid it contains). When the atmospheric pressure increases from $P_{\\mathrm{a}}=P_{0}$ , the fluid rises in the barometric tube while it descends in the cistern. As a result, the added mass in the tube increases, while the added mass in the cistern decreases.We denote $m_{\\mathrm{1,t b}}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{1,c}}$ the (algebraic) variation of the apparent masses of each container. Thus, the tensions exerted by the two cables can be written:\n\n$\\left[F_{0}+m_{\\mathrm{1,t b}}g\\right]\\overrightarrow{u_{x}}$ for the cable on the right, suspending the tube;\n\n$-\\left[F_{0}+m_{\\mathrm{1,c}}g\\right]\\overrightarrow{u_{x}}$ for the cable on the left, suspending the cistern.\n\nAccording to the principle of mass conservation, one can immediately state that $m_{\\mathrm{1,t b}}=-m_{\\mathrm{1,c}}$ .

One can use\n\nthe hydrostatic law :$\\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}=\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{l}}}{\\rho g}$ \n\nthe conservation of the total volume/mass of mercury :$S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}=-\\left[S_{\\mathrm{c}}-S_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right]\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}\\simeq-S_{\\mathrm{c}}\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (given that\n\n$\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\ll\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{b}},\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{c}})$ \n\nSolving the system formed by those equations, one finds\n\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}=-\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{b}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}-S_{\\mathrm{r}}}\\frac{P_{1}}{\\rho g}\\simeq-\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{b}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\frac{P_{1}}{\\rho g}$$\n\nwhich finally yields\n\n$$\\overrightarrow{R_{\\mathrm{t}}}=-\\frac{2S_{\\mathrm{b}}S_{\\mathrm{c}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}P_{1}\\overrightarrow{u_{x}}\\simeq-\\frac{2S_{\\mathrm{b}}S_{\\mathrm{c}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}}P_{1}\\overrightarrow{u_{x}}$$\n\nWith the triangular model for $P_{1}\\left(t\\right)$ , the maximum static friction force is obtained when $P_{1}=\\pm A$ Therefore, according to the Coulomb's law of friction, the mass M stays at rest if and only if\n\n$$\\frac{2S_{\\mathrm{b}}S_{\\mathrm{c}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}A<F_{\\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThis inequality can be rewritten as\n\n$$2<\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{b}}+S_{\\mathrm{c}}-S_{\\mathrm{t}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}S_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{s}}}{A}=\\xi $$\n\nwhich allows us to identify\n\n$$\\xi^{\\star}=2$$",

      "text": "Consider one of the collisions. Let it occur at a distance from the wall, and let v and V be the speeds of the ball and block, respectively, after the collision.We claim that the quantity $\\ell(v-V)$ is invariant. That is, it is the same for each collision. This can be seen as follows.\n\nThe time to the next collision is given by $V t+v t=2\\ell$ (because the sum of the distances traveled by the two objects is 2). Therefore, the next collision occurs at a distance c′ from the wall, whre \n\n$$\\ell^{\\prime}=\\ell-V t=\\ell-\frac{2\\ell V}{V+v}=\frac{\\ell(v-V)}{v+V}.$$ \n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\\ell^{\\prime}(v+V)=\\ell(v-V).$$ \n\nWe now make use of the fact that in an elastic collision, the relative speed before the collision equals the relative speed after the collision. (This is most easily seen by working in the center of mass frame, where this scenario clearly satisfies conservation of $E$ and $|p.)$ Therefore, if $v^{\\prime}$ and $V^{\\prime}$ are the speeds after the next collision, then \n\n$$v+V=v^{\\prime}-V^{\\prime}.$$ \n\nUsing this in eq. (2) gives \n\n$$\\ell^{\\prime}(v^{\\prime}-V^{\\prime})=\\ell(v-V),$$ \n\nas we wanted to show.\n\nWhat is the value of this invariant? After the first collision, the block continues to move at speed $V_{0}$ , up to corrections of order $m/M$ . And the ball acquires a speed of $2V_{0}$ , up to corrections of order $m/M$ . (This can be seen by working in the frame of the heavy block, or equivalently by using eq. (3) with $V^{\\prime}\\approx$ :$V=V_{0}{\\mathrm{~a n d~}}v=0.)$ Therefore, the invariant $\\ell(v-V)$ is essentially equal to \n\n$L(2V_{0}-V_{0})=L V_{0}$ \n\n\n\nLet $L_{\\mathrm{m i n}}$ be the closest distance to the wall. When the block reaches this closest point, its speed is (essentially) zero. Hence, all of the initial kinetic energy of the block now belongs to the ball. Therefore,$v=V_{0}\\sqrt{M/m}$ ,and our invariant tells us that $L V_{0}=L_{\\mathrm{m i n}}(V_{0}\\sqrt{M/m}-0)$ . Thus,\n\n$$L_{\\mathrm{m i n}}=L\\sqrt{\frac{m}{M}}.$$",

The two slowest-degrading materials have a number of factors lowering their degradation rate: They are both semicrystalline.PLLA has the pendant methyl groups creating a steric barrier to the approach of water to the backbone. PCL is more hydrophobic and generally is highly crystalline, because its linear backbone readily packs into extensive crystallites (relative to PLLA). PLGA breaks down more quickly than PLLA because the mixture of lactide and glycolide repeat units in the chain prevents crystallization,and glycolide, lacking the bulky methyl groups, is more readily attacked by water. Lastly, PLA-bPEO, though crystallizable, are much more quickly degraded than the other materials due to the greatly enhanced entry of water into the hydrophilic PEO domains.",

We repeat a similar calculation from before. Four of the components are unmodified, so we have a similar calculation for those, except now there are 23 vertices: The first component contributes 3*(3/23)=(9/23) to the expectation.

      "text": "The best RM code in Table 2 is the (64,22,16) code, which has an effective coding gain of 6.0 dB. Repeating the calculations in part (c) above for one tenth the power, we find that this code can support a rate of about \n$$R\\approx4P/9\\approx44,000\\mathrm{b/s},$$\n4 times (6 dB) more than what we can achieve with uncoded modulation, but 3.3 times (5.2 dB) less than capacity.\nThe only potentially better codes that we know of so far are the orthogonal-simplexbiorthogonal family, whose performance we know approaches the ultimate Shannon limit on $E_{b}/N_{0}\\mathrm{a s}M\\to\\infty$ , albeit with $\\rho\\to0$ \nLet us therefore try biorthogonal codes, the most bandwidth-efficient in this family. We know that the binary image of a $(2^{m},m+1,2^{m-1})$ |binary linear block code is a $2^{m+1}.$ biorthogonal code.\nIf we are going to achieve a rate higher than 44$\\mathrm{k b/s}$ , then we are going to need an effective coding gain greater than 6 dB and a spectral efficiency greater than 0.044$\\mathrm{b/2D}$ \nThe nominal coding gain of a $(2^{m},m+1,2^{m-1})$ code is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{c}}=k d/n=(m+1)/2$ ,So we are going to need to choose $m\\geq8$ . The spectral efficiency is $\\rho=2k/n=(m+1)2^{-m+1}$ ,which limits us to $m\\leq8$ ,since for $m=9,\\rho=10/256=0.039\\mathrm{b/2D}$ \nLet us therefore try the (256,9,128) biorthogonal code. This code has a nominal coding gain of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{c}}=k d/n=4.5\\left(6.53\\mathrm{d B}\\right)$ . It has $N_{d}=2^{9}-2=510$ weight-128 codewords,SO $K_{b}=N_{d}/k\\approx57$ . Since this is about 6 factors of two, its effective coding gain is only about 5.3 dB, which is not good enough to improve on the (64, 22,16) code. So we conclude that no biorthogonal code can improve on the (64, 22, 16) code in this problem.Another approach is to examine RM codes of greater length. However, you were not expected to go further in this problem; consideration only of RM codes of lengths $n\\leq64$ and biorthogonal codes suffices for full credit.\n[ExTRA CREDIT] However, if you do go further, you will find for example that there is a (128,29,32) RM code which can be constructed from the (64,22,16) code and the (64, 7,32) code. This code has a nominal coding gain of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{c}}=k d/n=29/4=7.25$ (8.6dB), and a nominal spectral efficiency of $\\rho=2k/n=29/64=0.45$ , which are both fine.Its number of nearest neighbors is \n$$N_{d}=4\\frac{127\\cdot63\\cdot31\\cdot15\\cdot7}{31\\cdot15\\cdot7\\cdot3\\cdot1}=10668,$$ \nSO $K_{b}=N_{d}/k\\approx368$ , which is about 8.5 binary orders of magnitude. Its effective coding gain by our rule of thumb (which is questionable for such large numbers) is therefore about $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{e f f}}=8.6-1.7\\approx6.9$ dB. If this estimate is accurate, then the data rate can be improved by 0.9 dB, or about 23%; i.e., to $R\\approx54,000\\mathrm{b/s}$ . However, the decoding complexity increases very significantly (trellis complexity $=2^{15}$ states).",

      "text": "Consider a 1-mile-by-2-mile homogeneous service region served by two mobile patrolling servers as shown in Figure 1. Here are the assumptions of the model:\n1. Customer locations are uniformly independently located over the entire rectangular service region.\n2. Over time, customers arrive as a homogeneous Poisson process at aggregate rate $\\lambda=2$ customers per hour.\n3. While not busy serving customers, each server patrols its sector (sector 1 or 2, respectively).Under this circumstance, the server's location at a random time is uniformly distributed over its sector. Each sector is a one-mile-by-one-mile square.\n4. Travel distance is right-angle (\"Manhattan metric\"), with speed equal to 1000 mi/hr.\n5. The on-scene time to serve a customer is a random variable having a negative exponential probability density function with mean equal to 30 minutes. Upon completion of service of a customer at the scene, the server resumes random patrol of his/her sector.\nNow consider the situation as shown in Figure 2. Assumptions 1 through 5 above remain correct. However, Assumption 6 is altered as follows:\nCase in which both servers are available: For a customer from a part of sector i not in Buffer Zone i, dispatch server i. For a customer in Buffer Zone i, dispatch the other server only if that other server is within its own buffer zone and server i is not within its buffer zone; else dispatch server i to that customer.\nCase in which only one server is available: Dispatch that server.\nElse the customer is lost forever.\n<image>\nFigure 2\nUnder this new dispatch policy, determine the fraction of dispatch assignments that send server 1 to sector 2.",

To compute the average number of customers served by the second case, let us first find the probability that server 2 is idle outside buff er zone 2 and server 1 is idle inside buffer zone 1.

      "text": "Jack is a gambler who pays for his MIT tuition by spending weekends in Las Vegas. Lately he's been playing 21 at a table that returns cards to the deck and reshuffes them all before each hand.As he has a fixed policy in how he plays, his probability of winning a particular hand remains constant, and is independent of all other hands. There is a wrinkle, however; the dealer switches between two decks (deck #2 is more unfair to Jack than deck #1), depending on whether or not Jack wins. Jack's wins and losses can be modeled via the transitions of the following Markov chain, whose states correspond to the particular deck being used.\n\n<image>\nGiven that Jack loses and the dealer is not occupied with switching decks, with probability $\\frac{2}{8}$ the dealer looks away for one second and with probability $\\frac{1}{8}$ the dealer looks away for two seconds,independently of everything else. When this happens, Jack secretly inserts additional cards into both of the dealer's decks, transforming the decks into types 1A & 2A (when he has 1 second)or 1B & 2B (when he has 2 seconds). Jack slips cards into the decks at most once. The process can be described by the modified Markov chain in the picture. Assume in all future problems that play begins with the dealer using deck $\\#1$ \n\n<image>\n\nWhat is the distribution of the number of wins that Jack has before he slips extra cards into the deck?

      "text": "## WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\n### A. Introduction \n\nRice is the main staple food of most people in Vietnam. To make white rice from paddy rice, one needs separate of the husk (a process called \"hulling\") and separate the bran layer (\"milling\"). The hilly parts of northern Vietnam are abundant with water streams, and people living there use water-powered rice-pounding mortar for bran layer separation. Figure 1 shows one of such mortars., Figure 2 shows how it works.\n\n### B. Design and operation \n\n### 1. Design\n\nThe rice-pounding mortar shown in Figure 1 has the following parts:The mortar, basically a wooden container for rice.\n\nThe lever, which is a tree trunk with one larger end and one smaller end. It can rotate around a horizontal axis. A pestle is atached perpendicularly to the lever at the smaller end. The length of the pestle is such that it touches the rice in the mortar when the lever lies horizontally. The larger end of the lever is carved hollow to form a bucket. The shape of the bucket is crucial for the mortar's operation.\n\n### 2. Modes of operation \n\nThe mortar has two modes.\n\nWorking mode. In this mode, the mortar goes through an operation cycle illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nThe rice-pounding function comes from the work that is transferred from the pestle to the rice during stage f) of Figure 2. If, for some reason, the pestle never touches the rice,we say that the mortar is not working.\n\nRest mode with the lever lifted up. During stage c) of the operation cycle (Figure 2),as the tilt angle α increases, the amount of water in the bucket decreases. At one particular moment in time, the amount of water is just enough to counterbalance the weight of the lever. Denote the tilting angle at this instant by β. If the lever is kept at angle β and the initial angular velocity is zero, then the lever will remain at this position forever. This is the rest mode with the lever lifted up. The stability of this position depends on the flow rate of water into the bucket, Φ. If Φ exceeds some value $\\Phi_{2}$ , then this rest mode is stable, and the mortar cannot be in the working mode.In other words,$\\Phi_{2}$ is the minimal flow rate for the mortar not to work.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 1A water-powered rice-pounding mortar \n\n## OPERATION CYCLE OF A WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\n<image>\n\nFigure 2\n\na) At the beginning there is no water in the bucket, the pestle rests on the mortar.Water flows into the bucket with a small rate, but for some time the lever remains in the horizontal position.\n\nb) At some moment the amount of water is enough to lift the lever up. Due to the tilt, water rushes to the farther side of the bucket, tilting the lever more quickly Water starts to flow out at $\\alpha=\\alpha_{1}$ \n\nc) As the angle α increases, water starts to flow out. At some particular tilt angle,$\\alpha=\\beta$ , , the total torque is zero.\n\nd) α continues increasing, water continues to flow out until no water remains in the bucket.\n\n\ne) α keeps increasing because of inertia. Due to the shape of the bucket,water falls into the bucket but immediately flows out. The inertial motion of the lever continues until αreaches the maximal value $\\alpha_{0}$ \n\nf) With no water in the bucket, the weight of the lever pulls it back to the initial horizontal position. The pestle gives the mortar (with rice inside) a pound and a new cycle begins.\n\n### C. The problem \n\nConsider a water-powered rice-pounding mortar with the following parameters (Figure 3)\n\nThe mass of the lever (including the pestle but without water) is $M=30kg$ \n\nThe center of mass of the lever is G. The lever rotates around the axis T (projected onto the point T on the figure).\n\nThe moment of inertia of the lever around T is $I=12\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$ \n\nWhen there is water in the bucket, the mass of water is denoted as m, the center of mass of the water body is denoted as N.\n\nThe tilt angle of the lever with respect to the horizontal axis is α .\n\nThe main length measurements of the mortar and the bucket are as in Figure 3.\n\nNeglect friction at the rotation axis and the force due to water falling onto the bucket.In this problem, we make an approximation that the water surface is always horizontal.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 3 Design and dimensions of the rice-pounding mortar \n\n### 3. The rest mode \nLet water flow into the bucket with a constant rate Φ, but one cannot neglect the amount of water flowing into the bucket during the motion of the lever. \n Assuming the bucket is always overflown with water,\n\n Find the analytic form of the torque  as a function of $\\Delta\\alpha$ when $\\alpha=\\beta+\\Delta\\alpha$ , and $\\Delta\\alpha$ is small.",

We can therefore reduce the problem to tiling a $1\\times10$ I rectangle with $1\\times3$ rectangles and $1\\times1$ squares.\\n\\nWe can compute the number of ways to tile this rectangle using recursion. Let $T_{n}$ be the number of tiling a $1\\times n$ rectangle with $1\\times3$ and $1\\times1$ tiles. We can tile a $1\\times n$ rectangle by first placing either a $1\\times1{\\mathrm{~o r~a~}}1\\times3$ tile on the left. If we place a $1\\times1$ tile, then the number of ways of tiling the remaining $n-1$ squares is $T_{n-1}$ . If we place a $1\\times3$ tile, then the number of ways of tiling the remaining $n-3$ squares is $T_{n-3}$ . Thus $T_{n}=T_{n-1}+T_{n-3}$ 3. Using $T_{0}=T_{1}=T_{2}=1$ -$T_{0}=T_{1}=T_{2}=1$ ,we can use this recursive formula to compute $T_{n}$ :\\n\\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>n</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tn</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>13</td><td>19</td><td>28</td></tr></table>\\n\\nThus there are $28$ ways of tiling the rectangle.(cd:)",

To see that this is so, consider a small glass triangular prism with an apex angle \\(A=\\pi-2 \\alpha\\), a base of length \\(2 h\\) and a width \\(w\\). The prism has an index of refraction \\(n\\) and a mass density \\(\rho\\).\n\nSuppose that this prism is placed in a laser beam travelling horizontally in the \\(x\\) direction. (Throughout this problem assume that the prism does not rotate, i.e., its apex always points opposite to the direction of the laser beam, its triangular faces are parallel to the \\(x y\\) plane, and its base is parallel to the \\(y z\\) plane, as shown in Fig. 1.) Take the index of refraction of the surrounding air to be \\(n_{\text {air }}=1\\). Assume that the faces of the prism are coated with an anti-reflection coating so that no reflection occurs.\n\nThe laser beam has an intensity that is uniform across its width in the \\(z\\) direction but falls off linearly with distance \\(y\\) from the \\(x\\) axis such that it has a maximum value of \\(I_{0}\\) at \\(y=0\\) and falls to zero at \\(y= \\pm 4 h\\) (Fig. 2). [Intensity is power per unit area, e.g. expressed in \\(\\mathrm{W} \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\).]\n<image> <Figure caption:Fig. 2.>\nSuppose that the laser beam is 1 mm wide in the \\(z\\) direction and \\(80 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}\\) thick (in the \\(y\\) direction).

Then R can be augmented to produce animals $\tilde{R}\\supset R a n d\tilde{B}=D\\setminus\tilde{R}$ such that at least one of the following holds: $$\begin{aligned}(i)&\\quad|\tilde{R}|\\geq s and|\tilde{B}|\\geq s,\\ (ii)&\\quad|\tilde{R}|=|R|+1,\\ (iii)&\\quad|R|<|\tilde{R}|\\leq s-1.\\end{aligned}$$ Proof. If there is a black cell adjacent to R that can be made red without disconnecting B,then (ii) holds. Otherwise, there is a black cell c adjacent to R whose removal disconnects B. Of the squares adjacent to c, at least one is red, and at least one is black, otherwise B would be disconnected. Then there are at most three resulting components $\\mathcal{C}_{1},\\mathcal{C}_{2},\\mathcal{C}_{3}$ of B after the removal of c. Without loss of generality,$\\mathcal{C}_{3}$ is the largest of the remaining components. (Note that $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ or $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ may be empty.) Now $\\mathcal{C}_{3}$ has at least $\\left\\lceil(3s-2)/3\right\rceil=s$ cells. Let $\tilde{B}=\\mathcal{C}_{3}$ . Then $|\tilde{R}|=|R|+|\\mathcal{C}_{1}|+|\\mathcal{C}_{2}|+1.\\quad\\mathrm{I f}\\quad|\tilde{B}|\\leq3s-2$ ,then $|\tilde{R}|\\geq s$ and (i) holds. If $|\tilde{B}|\\geq3s-1$ then either (ii) or (ii) holds, depending on whether $|\tilde{R}|\\geq s$ or not. Starting with $|R|=1$ ., repeatedly apply the Lemma. Because in alternatives (ii) and (iii)$|R|$ increases but remains less than s, alternative (i) eventually must occur. This shows that no dinosaur with at least $4(s-1)+2$ cells is primitive.",

      "text": "How are aurora ignited by the solar wind? <image> Figure 1. The following questions are designed to guide you to find the answer one step by one step. Background information of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field: It is well known that the Earth has a substantial magnetic field. The field lines defining the structure of the Earth's magnetic field is similar to that of a simple bar magnet, as shown in Figure 2. The Earth's magnetic field is disturbed by the solar wind, whichis a high-speed stream of hot plasma. (The plasma is the quasi-neutralionized gas.)The plasma blows outward from the Sun and varies in intensity with the amount of surface activity on the Sun. The solar wind compresses the Earth's magnetic field. On the other hand, the Earth's magnetic field shields the Earth from much of the solar wind. When the solar wind encounters the Earth's magnetic field, it is deflected like water around the bow of a ship, as illustrated in Figure 3. <image> Magnetic Field Lines Figure 2 <image> Figure 3 The curved surface at which the solar wind is first deflected is called the bow shock. The corresponding region behind the bow shock andfront of the Earth's magnetic field is called themagnetosheath. The region surroundedby the solar wind is called the magnetosphere.The Earth's magnetic field largely prevents the solar wind from enteringthe magnetosphere. The contact region between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field is named the magnetopause.The location of the magnetopause is mainly determined by the intensity and the magnetic field direction of the solar wind. When the magnetic field in the solar wind is antiparallel to the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic reconnection as shown in Figure 4 takes place at the dayside magnetopause, which allows some charged particles ofthe solar wind in the region \"A\" to move into the magnetotail \"P\" on the night side as illustrated in Figure 5. A powerful solar wind can push the dayside magnetopause tovery close to the Earth, which could cause a high-orbit satellite (such as a geosynchronous satellite) to be fully exposed to the solar wind. The energetic particles in the solar wind could damage high-tech electronic components in a satellite. Therefore, i isimportant to study the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, which will give an answer of the aurora generation and could help us to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. $$\\mathbf{t}{=}\\mathbf{t_{0}}$$ $$\\mathbf{t}{=}\\mathbf{t_{l}}$$ <image> Figure 5.

As mentioned above, a powerful solar wind can push the dayside magnetopause tovery close to the Earth, which could cause a high-orbit satelliteto be fully exposed to the solar wind. The energetic particles in the solar wind could damage high-tech electronic components in a satellite.For simplicity, the Earth's dipole magnetic field is assumed to remain unchanged when the solar wind compresses it and that the plasma density is ignorable in the magnetosphere. Please give the minimum solar wind speed to cause a damage of a geosynchronous satellite if the magnetic field strength and the plasma density of the solar wind are $B_{s}=5\\times10^{-9}\\mathrm{T}$ and $\\rho_{s}=50\\ \\mathrm{proton}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively.

      "text": "## WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\n### A. Introduction \n\nRice is the main staple food of most people in Vietnam. To make white rice from paddy rice, one needs separate of the husk (a process called \"hulling\") and separate the bran layer (\"milling\"). The hilly parts of northern Vietnam are abundant with water streams, and people living there use water-powered rice-pounding mortar for bran layer separation. Figure 1 shows one of such mortars., Figure 2 shows how it works.\n\n### B. Design and operation \n\n### 1. Design\n\nThe rice-pounding mortar shown in Figure 1 has the following parts:The mortar, basically a wooden container for rice.\n\nThe lever, which is a tree trunk with one larger end and one smaller end. It can rotate around a horizontal axis. A pestle is atached perpendicularly to the lever at the smaller end. The length of the pestle is such that it touches the rice in the mortar when the lever lies horizontally. The larger end of the lever is carved hollow to form a bucket. The shape of the bucket is crucial for the mortar's operation.\n\n### 2. Modes of operation \n\nThe mortar has two modes.\n\nWorking mode. In this mode, the mortar goes through an operation cycle illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nThe rice-pounding function comes from the work that is transferred from the pestle to the rice during stage f) of Figure 2. If, for some reason, the pestle never touches the rice,we say that the mortar is not working.\n\nRest mode with the lever lifted up. During stage c) of the operation cycle (Figure 2),as the tilt angle α increases, the amount of water in the bucket decreases. At one particular moment in time, the amount of water is just enough to counterbalance the weight of the lever. Denote the tilting angle at this instant by β. If the lever is kept at angle β and the initial angular velocity is zero, then the lever will remain at this position forever. This is the rest mode with the lever lifted up. The stability of this position depends on the flow rate of water into the bucket, Φ. If Φ exceeds some value $\\Phi_{2}$ , then this rest mode is stable, and the mortar cannot be in the working mode.In other words,$\\Phi_{2}$ is the minimal flow rate for the mortar not to work.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 1A water-powered rice-pounding mortar \n\n## OPERATION CYCLE OF A WATER-POWERED RICE-POUNDING MORTAR \n\n<image>\n\nFigure 2\n\na) At the beginning there is no water in the bucket, the pestle rests on the mortar.Water flows into the bucket with a small rate, but for some time the lever remains in the horizontal position.\n\nb) At some moment the amount of water is enough to lift the lever up. Due to the tilt, water rushes to the farther side of the bucket, tilting the lever more quickly Water starts to flow out at $\\alpha=\\alpha_{1}$ \n\nc) As the angle α increases, water starts to flow out. At some particular tilt angle,$\\alpha=\\beta$ , , the total torque is zero.\n\nd) α continues increasing, water continues to flow out until no water remains in the bucket.\n\n\ne) α keeps increasing because of inertia. Due to the shape of the bucket,water falls into the bucket but immediately flows out. The inertial motion of the lever continues until αreaches the maximal value $\\alpha_{0}$ \n\nf) With no water in the bucket, the weight of the lever pulls it back to the initial horizontal position. The pestle gives the mortar (with rice inside) a pound and a new cycle begins.\n\n### C. The problem \n\nConsider a water-powered rice-pounding mortar with the following parameters (Figure 3)\n\nThe mass of the lever (including the pestle but without water) is $M=30kg$ \n\nThe center of mass of the lever is G. The lever rotates around the axis T (projected onto the point T on the figure).\n\nThe moment of inertia of the lever around T is $I=12\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$ \n\nWhen there is water in the bucket, the mass of water is denoted as m, the center of mass of the water body is denoted as N.\n\nThe tilt angle of the lever with respect to the horizontal axis is α .\n\nThe main length measurements of the mortar and the bucket are as in Figure 3.\n\nNeglect friction at the rotation axis and the force due to water falling onto the bucket.In this problem, we make an approximation that the water surface is always horizontal.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 3 Design and dimensions of the rice-pounding mortar \n\n### 3. The rest mode \nLet water flow into the bucket with a constant rate Φ, but one cannot neglect the amount of water flowing into the bucket during the motion of the lever.\n\n At a given Φ, the bucket is overflown with water at all times only if the lever moves sufficiently slowly. There is an upper limit on the amplitude of harmonic oscillation, which depends on Φ. Determine the minimal value $\\Phi_{1}$ of Φ (in kg/s) so that the lever can make a harmonic oscillator motion with amplitude 10.",

First, note that we already found the voltage between a and b in part (a), and this is precisely the Thevenin emf,$V_{\\mathrm{e f f}}=5\\mathcal{E}/8$ . The Thevenin resistance is simply the equivalent resistance between a and b. By a straightforward application of the series and parallel rules, this is $R_{\\mathrm{e f f}}=\boxed{3R/8}.$ Second, suppose we short points a and b with a wire. Then by Thevenin's theorem, the current flowing through that wire should be $I=V_{\\mathrm{e f f}}/R_{\\mathrm{e f f}}$ . We already know $V_{\\mathrm{e f f}}$ from part (a). To compute the current, we just use Kirchof 's loop rules again; these are now as follows. $$\begin{aligned}{\\mathcal{E}-\\mathcal{E}-2R I_{1}+R I_{2}}&{{}=0,}\\ {\\mathcal{E}-2R I_{2}+R I_{1}}&{{}=0,}\\ {-\\mathcal{E}-R I_{3}}&{{}=0.}\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Solving these equations gives $I_{1}=\\mathcal{E}/3R,\thinspace I_{2}=2\\mathcal{E}/3R,$and$I_{3}=-\\mathcal{E}/R$ .

The forces are g ds acting downward, a drag force $-f d\\mathbf{s}$ ,and tension forces on each side. Because the string is moving with constant speed, its acceleration is perpendicular to ds. Therefore, there is no net force parallel to ds, and balancing forces in that direction implies that the difference in tension forces has to be $$d T=f d s+\\mu g d y $$ where $d y$ is the y-component of $d s$ . In other words, the tension increases as one goes along the string, and as one goes to higher elevations. For the parts of the string just before and after the wheels, the heights are about the same, so the tension is higher just before going through the wheels. This makes sense, as the wheels are pulling the string in. Next, consider the forces perpendicular to ds. This contains contributions from the gravitational force and the tension forces, and needs to sum up to the centripetal force. We know from part (a) that at the point where $T=\\mu v^{2}$ , the tension alone accounts for the centripetal force. Then at this point, gravity can't contribute in this direction, so ds must be vertical. So point P is at the rightmost point on the loop. At other points, T is a bit diferent from $\\mu v^{2}$ ,so the difference is made up by gravity.

If the two faces of a slab of material with thermal conductivity κ, area A, and thickness d are held at temperatures differing by ∆T, the thermal power P transferred through the slab is $$P=\frac{\\kappa A\\Delta T}{d}$$ A heat exchanger is a device which transfers heat between a hot fluid and a cold fuid; they are common in industrial applications such as power plants and heating systems. The heat exchanger shown below consists of two rectangular tubes of length l, width w, and height h. The tubes are separated by a metal wall of thickness d and thermal conductivity κ. Originally hot fluid flows through the lower tube at a speed v from right to left, and originally cold ffuid flows through the upper tube in the opposite direction (left to right) at the same speed. The heat capacity per unit volume of both fluids is c. The hot fluid enters the heat exchanger at a higher temperature than the cold fuid; the difference between the temperatures of the entering fluids is $\\Delta T_{i}$ .

    "answer": {
      "text": "To see why the temperature difference across the wall is the same everywhere along the wall,note that at every point along the wall, the warmer fluid on one side transfers energy to the colder fluid on the other. Since the heat capacities are equal, the temperature of the warmer fluid drops atthe same rate the temperature of the colder fluidrises. But since the fuids move at the same speed in opposite directions, this means the temperature difference is constant. Suppose this temperature difference is $\\Delta T_{w}$ Since the total area of the wall is $l w$ , the power transferred across the wall is $$P=\frac{\\kappa l w}{d}\\Delta T_{w}$$ In a time $d t$ , the energy transferred is therefore $$d E=\frac{\\kappa l w}{d}\\Delta T_{w}\\;d t.$$ Meanwhile, suppose the red fuid enters at temperature $T_{r}$ and the blue fuid at temperature $T_{b}$ The red fluid exits at temperature $T_{b}+\\Delta T_{w}.$ ,so the overall temperature change of the red fluid is $$\\Delta T_{r}=T_{r}-(T_{b}+\\Delta T_{w})=\\Delta T_{i}-\\Delta T_{w}$$ In a time $d t$ ,a volume of red ffuid vwh dt enters the pipe, and the same volume leaves,witha ,temperature $\\Delta T_{r}$ .higher. Then the total energy transferred to the red fuid is $$d E=v w h c\\;d t\\;\\Delta T_{r}=v w h c(\\Delta T_{i}-\\Delta T_{w})\\;d t.$$ We would get the same equation if we considered the blue fluid, as expected by energy conservation.However, this requires vwhc to be the same for both fluids. If this were not true, we would instead get a contradiction, reflecting the fact that $\\Delta T_{w}$ could not be constant. Equating our two expressions for $d E$ gives $$\frac{\\kappa l w}{d}\\Delta T_{w}=v w h c(\\Delta T_{i}-\\Delta T_{w})\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\\Delta T_{w}=\frac{\\Delta T_{i}}{1+\\alpha},\\quad\\alpha=\frac{\\kappa l}{d v h c}.$$ Because the red fluid exits at $T_{b}+\\Delta T_{w}$ and the blue fluid exits at $T_{r}-\\Delta T_{w}$ $$\\Delta T_{f}=(T_{b}+\\Delta T_{w})-(T_{r}-\\Delta T_{w})=-\\Delta T_{i}+2\\Delta T_{w}=\\Delta T_{i}\\left(\frac{2}{1+\\alpha}-1\right)$$ The performance of the heat exchanger is determined by the dimensionless parameter α. There are several ways we can check this result. We can check if α is correct by dimensional analysis or common sense; for example, it's clear that a long pipe improves performance. We also see that in the limit of poor performance,$\\alpha\rightarrow0$ ,we find no heat exchange at all,$\\Delta T_{f}=\\Delta T_{i}$ The best possible performance, attained for $\\alpha\to\\infty,\\mathrm{i s}\\Delta T_{f}=-\\Delta T_{i}$ , a complete reversal of the temperatures of the fluids. This is much better than the best possible performance if the two fluids moved the same direction, which would be $\\Delta T_{f}=0$ The general idea here is called countercurrent heat exchange, and it appears in both biology and practical engineering.",

Due to symmetry (or balance of forces in the z-direction) forces $F_{B E}=F_{B D}$ i.Projecting the forces $F_{B E}$ and $F_{B D}$ in the x-direction and applying balance of forces in this direction gives \n$$\\begin{aligned}\\sum F_{x}=0,\\-F_{BE}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta-F_{BD}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta+W=0,\\F_{BE}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta+F_{BD}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta=W,\\2F_{BE}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta=W.\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere we define the angles φ and θ in the planar triangles given in Figures 3and 4. From the Figures, cOs $\\begin{array}{r}{\\phi=\\frac{\\sqrt{125}}{\\sqrt{350}}}\\end{array}$ and cos $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta=\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{125}}}\\end{array}$ . This gives \n$$2F_{B E}\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta=W $$\n$$2F_{B E}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{125}}{\\sqrt{350}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{125}}\\right)=W $$\n$$F_{B E}={\\frac{\\sqrt{350}}{20}}W=14031{\\mathrm{~l b}}$$\nThus,$\\boxed{F_{B E}=F_{B D}=14031~\\mathrm{l b}}$",

This is arbitrary, since for any point on a surface there are two normal vectors which point in opposite directions. Applying Faraday's law requires making a consistent choice.\n\nHowever, some surfaces are nonorientable, which means it is impossible to define the normal vector on the surface continuously. Concretely, what happens is that if we draw a normal vector at some point (arbitrarily picking up or down), and continuously extend this definition around the surface, we come back to the same point but with the normal vector pointing in the opposite direction. The surface on the right, which is a Mobius strip, has exactly this problem. For this reason, we can't define the flux through it at all! In order to apply Faraday's law (or Gauss's law,etc.) we always have to use orientable surfaces like the one on the left. Thankfully, for any closed loop, an orientable surface whose boundary is the loop always exists; it's called a Seifert surface.\n\nThe flux through the left surface is about $2\\pi R^{2}B$ .In general, for N turns, we would get a flux of about $N\\pi R^{2}B$ , though this gets hard to visualize in terms of surfaces.",

The length of each sector is one mile.\n\n<image>\n\nThe pictures above the sectors are shown to remind you that we are dealing with police patrol cars, each of which patrols its own sector, A, B or C, respectively, uniformly when not responding to a call for service. The dispatch strategy (or, 'server assignment strategy) is as follows: If a call for service arises in a given sector, dispatch that sector's police car, if it is available; otherwise dispatch the closest available police car. If all three police cars are simultaneously busy when the call arrives, the call is LOST to the system forever. Thus, police cars are dispatched only from the idle or patrolling state. Since it will be patrolling when dispatched, the police car's location upon dispatch is drawn from a uniform distribution over its one-mile-long sector. Calls for police service arise in accordance with a homogeneous Poisson process, with rate $\\lambda=1.5$ calls/hour. The location of each respective call is drawn from a uniform distribution over the entire three-mile length of the three sectors combined. Thus, each sector generates internally 1/3 of the entire region's workload. Each dispatched police car responds at 1000 mi/hr (these are fast cars!). Service time at the scene is a random variable that is negative exponential with mean one hour. All service times are mutually independent. Upon completion of service on a call, the police car returns at 1000 mi/hr to its sector and resumes random patrolling.\n\nDetermine the fraction of dispatch assignments that are intra-sector assignments,i.e., the fraction of calls for service, over the entire region, that are responded to by the car assigned to the sector containing the call.",

Consider how the voltage across the capacitor varies,at lowest order. We have \n$$V_{C}=\\frac{Q+q}{C}=\\frac{(Q+q)(X_{1}+x)}{S\\epsilon_{0}}.$$\nThus, neglecting a second order term, the change in the voltage from equilibrium is \n$$\\delta V_{C}=\\frac{q X_{1}+Q x}{S\\epsilon_{0}}.$$\nTherefore, the perturbed Kirchoff's loop rule is \n$$L\\ddot{q}=-\\delta V_{C}=-\\frac{q X_{1}}{S\\epsilon_{0}}-\\frac{Q x}{S\\epsilon_{0}}.$$\nNext, consider the perturbation to the force.

When execution hits this point,the packet has been transferred to the receiving machine and the actions of the sending machine will not be on the critical path again until it receives the acknowledgement for the packet it sent.\nb.Step 6, NIC2 receives a packet. You can consider NIC2 to be receiving a bit immediately when NIC1 transmits it, and vice versa. In truth, there is some delay (essentially the speed of light over whatever the transmission medium is), but in this case we will ignore it.\n\nc.Step 12, NIC1 receives a packet.

      "text": "The total angular momentum of the coin about its COM is the sum of the spin angular momentum and precession angular momentum vectors: $$\\vec{L}=\\vec{L}_{s}+\\vec{L}_{\\Omega}$$ The first is straightforward: $$\\vec{L}_{s}=\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}(-\\hat{r}\\cos\\alpha-\\hat{z}\\sin\\alpha)$$ $$\boxed{I_{\\parallel}}$$ The second is not because of the tilt of the coin, which leads to off-axis terms in the moment of inertia tensor (products of inertia). We can get an approximate handle on this by first breaking up the precession rotation vector into components parallel and perpendicular to the disk plane through the center of mass, as shown in the above diagram. Along these principal axes we compute the component angular momenta: $$L_{\\parallel}=I_{\\parallel}\\Omega\\cos\\alpha=\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega\\cos\\alpha $$ $$L_{\\perp}=I_{\\perp}\\Omega\\sin\\alpha=\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\Omega\\sin\\alpha $$ we now have to project these axes back along the polar coordinates: $$\begin{aligned}{}&{{}\\hat{\\parallel}=\\hat{z}\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha-\\hat{r}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha}\\\\ {}&{{}\\hat{\\perp}=\\hat{z}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha+\\hat{r}\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha}\\\\ {}&{{}\\operatorname{w h i c h~g i v e s:}}\\\\ {}&{{}\\vec{L}_{\\Omega}^{{C O M}}=\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega[\\hat{z}(\\operatorname{c o s}^{2}\\alpha+2\\operatorname{s i n}^{2}\\alpha)+\\hat{r}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha]\\approx\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega[\\hat{z}+\\alpha\\hat{r}]}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ where the latter comes from our small angle approximation. Combining this with the spin angular momentum (and keeping the same approximation): $$\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\vec{L}\\approx\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\\hat{z}(\frac{b}{R}-2\\alpha)+\\hat{r}(\frac{b}{R}\\alpha-2)]}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\boxed{\\approx\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\\hat{z}(\frac{b}{2R}-\\alpha)-\\hat{r}]}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\approx\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\frac{b}{2R}(1-\frac{3b\\omega_{s}^{2}}{g})\\hat{z}-\\hat{r}]}\\\\ \\end{array}$$ Note that we retain the assumption made in (c), that the radial angular momentum is primarily from the spin, and that because $\\mathrm{b}<<\\mathrm{R}$ . this component dominates the whole angular momentum vector, making the gyroscopic approximation a realistic one.",

      "text": "In class we have been looking at an ultrafiltration system for producing a protein product from the waste whey solution at a cheese plant. The whey produced from the manufacture of cheese is an aqueous solution containing the following solutes:\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>Solute</td><td>Weight (percent)</td></tr><tr><td>True protein (TP)</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Non-protein nitrogen NPN</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Lactose</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td>Ash</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Butterfat</td><td>0.05</td></tr></table>\nThe current plant generates $10^{6}$ pounds/day of whey solution that is currently dried by evaporation, and subsequent spray drying, to a product containing 13.5 percent protein (total of true protein and NPN). This product is sold for $0.15/pound as animal feed.\nWe are interested in making a protein product that contains a much higher percentage of protein.The current market for protein products is $0.65/pound for 35 percent protein and $1.50/pound for 50 percent protein. The lower amounts of lactose (higher level of protein) make the dry product more acceptable for human consumption. It may be possible to make even more money by concentrating the protein.\nThe higher concentration of protein can be achieved by ultrafiltration of the whey solution to separate lactose from the protein prior to drying. The membrane we are considering passes lactose and ash but rejects protein and fat. The rejection coefficients are:\n<table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td>Component R</td></tr><tr><td>Protein 0.96</td></tr><tr><td>NPN 0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Lactose 0.09</td></tr><tr><td>Ash 0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Butterfat 0.99</td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe rejection coefficient is defined as \n$$\\mathrm{R}=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}}$$ \nwhere $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is the mass fraction of a component in the permeate and $\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathfrak{c}}$ is the mass fraction of the component in the concentrate. The flux rate through the membrane was determined to be \n$$\\mathrm{N}''=5.4-2.1\\ln\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}$$ \nwhere $\\mathrm{N}''$ is in pounds per hour per square foot and $\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathfrak{c}}$ is the mass fraction of dissolved solutes in the concentrate. The higher concentration products can be achieved by ultrafiltration of the whey followed by use of the existing evaporators and spray dryer.\nThe permeate from the ultrafiltration process contains significant amounts of lactose. This solution can be evaporated to about 20 percent dissolved solids and given away as animal feed,or it can be shipped to a waste treatment plant for which the company will be charged a fee depending on amount of solution and concentration of solids.\nThe cartridges that are available each have 26.5$\\mathrm{f t}^{2}$ of mass transfer area. The inlet pressure to a cartridge is 30 psig, and the pressure drop through the cartridge on the retentate side is 15 psi,and the pressure drop across the membrane is 25 psi. The cartridges are arrayed in parallel as shown in Figure 1 and the concentration of protein in the bleed is maintained by adjusting the feed and bleed rates. To reduce concentration polarization, the flow through each cartridge should be maintained at 25 gpm by the recycle loop.\nThe ultrafiltration units can be operated only 20 hours per day since four hours each day must be used to clean and sterilize the ultrafiltration system. The costs for cleaning materials, water, and disposal of waste are small relative to other costs for the system.\n## Additional Technical and Financial Information \nDrying System \nPerformance of evaporator system \nlbs water 2.5\nlbs steam \nPerformance of spray dryer \nlbs water 0.5\nlbs steam \nCost of steam \n$\\S5/10^{6}$ Btu \nHeat of vaporization of water 900$\\frac{\\mathtt{B t u}}{\\mathtt{l b}}$ \n## Cartridge Characteristics \nTotal transfer area per cartride 26.5 ft2\nInlet pressure 30 psig \nPressure drop on retentate side 15 psi \nPressure drop across membrane 25 psi \nFlow rate of concentrate (to reduce 25 gpm concentration polarization)\n## Cartridge Cost and Lifetime \nCost of cartridge including gaskets,$225adapters \nUseful life 1 year \nCosts for Stages and Automation \nCost of a stage $1,250/cartridge \nCost/stage for multiple stages $10,000\nCost to automate $8,000/stage \nControl panel $50,000\nThese costs include stainless steel process piping that is 4 inch I.D. throughout the system.

A spreadsheet can be set up to calculate $\\mathrm{C_{B i}}$ ,the percentage of protein (both true protein and NPN) and the percentage of solids in the bleed stream in terms of the feed to bleed ratio, f, from the above equation. The cell defining the percentage of protein references the $\\mathrm{C_{B,i}}$ values as:\n\n$$\\%\\mathrm{Pr}\\mathrm{to}\\mathrm{in}=\\frac{\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{B},\\mathrm{TP}}+\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{B},\\mathrm{NPN}}}{\\Sigma\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{Bi}}}\\mathrm{x}100$$\n\n$$\\%Solids,total=\\sum C_{Bi}x100$$\n\nThe flux, N, is computed from the equation given in the problem statement:\n\n$$N=5.4-2.1\\ln C_{c}$$ \n\nwhere Cc is the mass fraction of solutes in the concentrate and is equal to the total percentage of solids (divided by 100). We can then calculate the total area of mass transfer required from the following equation:\n\n$$\\mathrm{A_{T}=\\frac{P_{l}\\left[\\frac{lb}{day}\\right]\\left[\\frac{1day}{20hr}\\right]}{N}}$$ \n\nwhere the day-to-hour conversion takes into account that the plant is operated only 20 hours per day.

      "text": "Particle physicists, condensed matter physicists, atomic physicists, and chemists all gain insight into the structure of matter by scattering experiments. In these experiments, we smash particles into other particles,look at what comes out, and infer what happened during the collision. In this lab, you will carry on this tradition by analyzing simulated collisions involving circular disks sliding on a horizontal table, with specified initial conditions. The disks always lay flat on the table, which is frictionless. In the simulation,collisions between objects obey the following rules:\n•The relative velocity along the normal direction is flipped in sign and multiplied by the coefficient of restitution c, where $c=1$ for a perfectly elastic collision.\n•The relative velocity along the tangential direction is changed by friction in the usual way: if it is zero, static friction tries to keep it zero, and if it is nonzero, it is pushed towards zero by a kinetic friction force $\\mu N$ , where N is the normal force.\nThere are many ways to extract the requested parameters, so you will be graded primarily on the precision and accuracy of your results. The initial conditions you specify will receive both inherent absolute and relative uncertainties, so you should choose appropriate values and perform multiple trials to get an accurate result. An uncertainty estimate is expected for all parts, but depending on how you carry out the experiment, each subpart might or might not require a graph. As always, include in your report any diagrams, supporting calculations, and other information necessary to show how you obtained your results.\nThis is a pure simulation experiment, with no physical equipment. The only thing required is the collision-black-box program to simulate collisions, which can be downloaded here.\nThe procedure to run the program depends on the operating system. On Windows:\n• Search for powershell in the start menu and run it to open a terminal. You will do the entire lab by typing commands into this terminal.\n• Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded collision-black-box program, by running cd <path-to-folder>. On most computers, the right command to run is cd ~/Downloads.\n•Use collision-black-box-windows.exe wall to run the first part of the experiment, and use collision-black-box-windows.exe disk to run the second part.\nOn macOS, the procedure is somewhat more complicated:\n•Launch the Terminal app. You will do the entire lab by typing commands into this terminal.\n•Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded collision-black-box program, by running cd <path-to-folder>. On most computers, the right command to run is cd ~/Downloads.\n• Run chmod +x collision-black-box-macos to mark the file as an executable program.\n• Run open . to open the current folder in Finder. In Finder, control-click the collision-black-box program to open a menu, and select Open. Confirm the dialog box that comes up. Another terminal will quickly appear and disappear. The program has now been granted permission to run.\n•Return to the terminal and use ./collision-black-box-macos wall to run the first part of the experiment, and use ./collision-black-box-macos disk to run the second part.\nIn this part, you will launch a \"probe\" disk towards a hidden, second disk on the table, which begins at rest with its center at an unknown position $(x_{0},y_{0})$ (where$x_{0}\thinspace>\thinspace0)$ ,with mass M and radius R. The probe disk has radius $r=(0.250\\pm0.001)\\mathrm{r}$ n, but you may choose its mass m, initial position (0, s), initial speed v, and the initial direction θ of its velocity (as an angle relative to the horizontal). Both disks are frictionless, so that rotation is irrelevant. The program will simulate the collision, if it occurs, and return the final velocity (speed and angle) of the probe disk.\n<image>\nThe parameters you choose must be in the following ranges:\n$$\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\bullet\\quad1\\mathrm{k g}\\leq m\\leq5\\mathrm{k g}.}\\\\ &{\\bullet\\quad-2\\mathrm{m}\\leq s\\leq2\\mathrm{m}.}\\\\ &{\\bullet\\quad0.5\\mathrm{m/s}\\leq v\\leq10.0\\mathrm{m/s}.}\\\\ &{\\bullet\\quad-90^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq90^{\\circ}.}\\end{array}$$\nThe parameters you specify are affected by the following uncertainties:\n•m: relative 1%, plus absolute 0.05 kg.\n•s: absolute 2 mm.\n•v: relative 1%, plus absolute 0.05 m/s.\n• θ: absolute 0.1°.\n Find the initial position $(x_{0},y_{0})$ of the hidden disk.",

      "text": "For all parts here, we always want to use $v=10\\mathrm{m/s}$ .As mentioned above,this reduces the effectof the absolute uncertainty on v, and makes the simulation run faster. For the first two parts,it's also nice to choose a high value of m so that the probe disk doesn't get bounced backwards, which makes things a bit more confusing. (a)We initially have no clue where the hidden disk is. To find it,it's easiest to set $\\theta=0$ and varys in steps ofr until we hit it for the first time, which should take just a couple tries. Now we can find the vertical position yo of the disk by adjusting s until $\\theta^{\\prime}=0$ , indicating a head-on collision. This requires multiple trials, since the uncertainties in the input parameters will affect $\\theta^{\\prime}$ . You can find $y_{0}$ by plotting s versus $\\theta^{\\prime}$ in the region of interest, drawing a line through the noisy data, and seeing where it crosses $\\theta^{\\prime}=0$ . (Or, if you're short on time, you could just imagine doing this and eyeball the answer directly from the data.) In either case, a good final result is \n$$y_{0}=\\left(-1.230\\pm0.003\\right)\\mathrm{m}.$$\nTo find $x_{0}$ ,we can try hitting the probe disk from the side. For example, we could take $\\theta=45^{\\circ}$ to keep the calculations simple,then vary s until we hit the disk again. Then we adjusts until $\\theta^{\\prime}=\\theta$ , again indicating a head-on collision, and extract $x_{0}=y_{0}-s$ . A good final result is \n$$x_{0}=(0.696\\pm0.003)\\mathrm{m}.$$\nIn both cases, there isn't a simple way to analytically estimate the uncertainty, but you should be able to get a comparable result by examining the data.",

      "text": "First, linear momentum is conserved; as it happens,the system begins with zero linear momentum. This eliminates choice (B). \n\nAngular momentum about any point is also conserved. (It is specified that the particles are point particles to rule out their having spin angular momentum.)As it happens, the system has zero linear momentum, so the angular momentum is the same measured about any point; otherwise it would sufi ce to consider any one point. The total angular momentum must be $2~\\mathrm{k g}\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$ counterclockwise. This eliminates choices (C) and (D).\n\nFinally, because the linear momentum of the system is zero, the center of mass does not move. This eliminates choice (A).\n\nReconciling the solution text with the image: The initial state shown in the diagram has both particles at the origin with velocities $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$. This means initial linear momentum $P = (1)(1,0) + (1)(-1,0) = (0,0)$. Initial angular momentum $L = (0,0,0) \times (1,0,0) + (0,0,0) \times (-1,0,0) = (0,0,0)$. The center of mass is initially at $(0,0)$ and its velocity is $(0,0)$. Due to internal forces only, $P$, $L$, and $R_{COM}$ (position of COM) must be conserved.\n\nEvaluating the options in the image:\n- **(A) (Top Left):** COM is at $(1,0)$, not $(0,0)$. Eliminated by COM conservation.\n- **(B) (Top Right):** Particle 1 at $(0,1)$ with $v=(1,0)$, Particle 2 at $(0,-1)$ with $v=(-1,0)$. Linear momentum $P=0$. Angular momentum $L = (0,1,0)\times(1,0,0) + (0,-1,0)\times(-1,0,0) = (0,0,-1) + (0,0,-1) = (0,0,-2)$ (clockwise). This is not $0$. Eliminated by angular momentum conservation.\n- **(C) (Middle Left):** Particle 1 at $(1,0)$ with $v=(0,1)$, Particle 2 at $(-1,0)$ with $v=(0,-1)$. Linear momentum $P=0$. Angular momentum $L = (1,0,0)\times(0,1,0) + (-1,0,0)\times(0,-1,0) = (0,0,1) + (0,0,1) = (0,0,2)$ (counter-clockwise). This is not $0$. Eliminated by angular momentum conservation.\n- **(D) (Middle Right):** Both particles at $(0,0)$, with velocities $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$. Linear momentum $P=0$. Angular momentum $L=0$. COM is at $(0,0)$. All conserved. This is a possible state.\n- **(E) (Bottom):** Particle 1 at $(0,1)$ with $v=(-1,0)$, Particle 2 at $(0,-1)$ with $v=(1,0)$. Linear momentum $P=0$. Angular momentum $L = (0,1,0)\times(-1,0,0) + (0,-1,0)\times(1,0,0) = (0,0,1) + (0,0,1) = (0,0,2)$ (counter-clockwise). This is not $0$.

The outlet temperature is calculated from Eq. (11) to be ~720 and ${\\sim}651{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for sodium and the liquid salt, respectively. As for the heat transfer coefficient, in the case of sodium $(Pr=0.037<<1$ ,turbulent,fullydeveloped flow, constant heat flux in round channel) the correct correlation is $N u=7+0.025P e^{0.8}$ (with $P e{=}R e{\\cdot}P r{\\sim}1114)$ ,from which weget $h=83.1\\ kW/m^2-K$ ,whereas in the case of liquid salt $(Pr=4.82>1$ , turbulent, fully-developed flow, constant heat flux in round channel) the Dittus-Boelter correlation is suitable, from which we get $h{\\sim}17.5\\mathrm{k W/m^{2}\\mathrm{-K}}$ .Substituting these values into Eq.

Assume a very simplified memory model where there is just one bank and there are two rows in the near segment and four rows in the far segment. The time to activate and precharge a row is 25ns in the near segment and 50ns in the far segment. The time from start of activation to reading data is 10ns in the near segment and 15ns in the far segment. All other timings are negligible for this problem. Given the following memory request stream, determine the optimal assignment (minimize average latency of requests) of rows in the near and far segment (assume a fixed mapping where rows cannot migrate, a closed-row policy, and the far segment is inclusive).\n\ntime Ons : row 0 read time 10ns : row 1 read time 100ns: row 2 read time 105ns: row 1 read time 200ns: row 3 read time 300ns: row 1 read \n\n(e) Assume now that there are eight (8) rows in the near segment. Below is a plot showing the number of misses to the near segment for three applications (A, B, and C) when run alone with the specified number of rows allocated to the application in the near segment. This is similar to the plots you saw in your Utility-Based Cache Partitioning reading except for TL-DRAM instead of a cache. Determine the optimal static partitioning of the near segment when all three of these applications are run together on the system.

Figure 1 shows the relation between the force F and the spring length L for a ZLS, where the slope of the line is the spring constant k.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 1: the relation between the force F and the spring length L\n\nA ZLS is useful in seismography and allows very accurate measurement of changes in the gravitational acceleration g. Here, we shall consider a homogenous ZLS, whose weight $M g$ exceeds $k L_{0}$ .We define a corresponding dimensionless ratio,$\\alpha=k L_{0}/M g<1$ to characterize the relative softness of the spring.The toy known as \"slinky\" may be (but not necessarily) such a ZLS.\n\nThroughout this question, we will denote a point on the spring by its distance $0\\leq\\ell\\leq L_{0}$ from the bottom of the spring when it is unstretched. In particular, for every point on the spring,  remains unchanged as the spring stretches.\n\n Dynamics\nExperiments show that when the spring is hung at rest and then released, it gradually contracts from the top, while the lower part remains stationary (see Figure 2). As time advances, the contracting part moves as a solid chunk and accumulates additional turns of the spring, while the stationary part becomes shorter. Every point on the spring begins to move only when the moving part reaches it. The bottom end of the spring starts moving only when the spring is fully collapsed and reaches its unstretched length $L_{0}$ . After that, the contracted spring continues falling straight downwards, without tumbling, as a rigid body under the influence of gravity.\n\n<image>\n\nFigure 2: Left: a sequence of pictures taken during the free fall of slinky. Right: the moving part I and the stationary part II during the free fall of the spring.\n\nIn the remaining parts of the question, you are asked to base your solution on this described model. You may neglect air resistance, but you are not allowed to neglect $L_{0}$\nCalculate the time $t_{c}$ it takes from the moment the spring is released, until it fully collapses back to its minimal length $L_{0}$ . Express your answer in terms of $L_{0},g$ and $\\alpha$ \nCompute the numerical value of $t_{c}$ for a spring with $k=1.02\\mathrm{~N/m},L_{0}=0.055\\mathrm{m}$ \nand $M=0.201$ kg, while taking $g$ to be $9.8\\dot{0}\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{\\bar{s}^{2}}$",

Let the origin be at the center of the large conductor.\n\nThe magnetic field inside a solid cylinder of radius $R$ carrying uniform current density $J$ is given by Ampere's Law as $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 J r}{2}$ (for $r < R$).\n\nLet the center of the large conductor be at the origin (0,0) and the center of the hole be at $(d,0)$ where $d = R_1 - R_2$.

      "text": "<image> Chassis Engineering by Herb Adams In this problem, we will investigate basic vehicle traction principles. The most important vehicle components when it comes to traction are the tires, since they are the only actual interface between the road and the car. The figure above is a tire performance curve, which illustrates the nonlinear relationship between vertical load on a tire and available traction. As the vertical load on this tire increases, it's cornering efficiency decreases. Assume all vehicles in this problem are using tires that can be represented by the above curve. b)We are now racing a heavier, 300 Ib vehicle around a circular race track. As the car turns (going counterclockwise), there will be a lateral weight transfer from the left to the right side of the vehicle.Use the following simplified formula to determine the weight transfer we would expect with a 1g cornering force, where 'Wcar is the weight of the car, 'a' is the cornering acceleration in $\\mathsf{g}^{\\prime}\\mathsf{s}$ , 'hcg'is the height of the center of gravity in inches (assume 20 inches),$\\mathrm{{'g'}}$ is gravity, and 'Itrack' is the vehicle track width (assume 60 inches). $$W_{T}=\\frac{W_{c a r}*a*h_{c g}}{g*l_{t r a c k}}$$ Determine the traction that each wheel is able to maintain after the weight shift.

The distance between L1 and L2 is $(20-x)$ cm, as shown; that is, once we specify x this distance is also specified. The distance between L2 and L3 is fixed to 8 cm, as shown.\n\nThe system's aperture stop (AS) is located 20 cm to the left of L1, and its half—size is 2 cm. The system's field stop (FS) is located 5 cm to the right of L3, overlapping with the image plane. The FS half—size is 1 cm.\n\nThe instrument is intended for imaging objects at infinity. If a parallel ray bundle from such an object arrives at angle α with respect to the optical axis, the instrument is required to form a real image of height $h=\\pm50\\alpha$ at the image plane.

      "text": "Sketch the mechanism in a position that places it in static equilibrium. Base your drawing on an estimate of the displacements to within ± 20%. Assume the joints have negligable friction and that the pulleys and links have negiligable weight. The 10cm radius pulley is fixed with respect to the table and cannot rotate. You can assume the toothed belt will not slip. The extension springs are at their natural length. You may assume that the extension springs apply tension with the spring constant indicated but cannot apply any appreciable force in compression (they buckle). Briefly justify your solution with a couple equations, schematic diagrams, and/or a few sentences of explanation. Be sure to indicate clearly:\nWhether you think the 3cm pulley rotates clockwise or counterclockwise \nWhether you think the arm connecting the pulleys rotates clockwise or counterclockwise \nWhether you think the arm 1 kg mass is higher or lower at equilibrium than at the starting position \n<image>",

      "text": "Consider a modest clockwise rotation of the arm, say 0.1 radian (6 deg). To maintain the proper position of the belt, tangent to both pulleys, the belt will have to wrap arong the top of the 10 cm rad pulley by 10cm*0.1 rad or 1cm. The kinematics of a belt drive demand that the same 1cm of belt feeds off of the 3cm pulley which requires a $\\mathbf{1cm}/\\mathbf{3cm}=0.33$ rad (18 deg) rotation of the 3cm dia pulley relative to the arm or 0.23 with respect to the fixed frame of reference.\n\nThis 0.1 deg rotation of the arm would also extend the left spring by 1.1cm leading to a 11N downward foce. The extension spring on the right side is placed in compression and we assume it buckles out of the way or othjerwise goes slack and applies negligable force.\n\nDue to the small angles and generous ± 20%allowance for our estimate, we can linearize. We have a motion of the weight due to two factors:Rotation of the $\\mathrm{arm}=\\mathrm{0.1rad}*\\mathrm{24cm}=\\mathrm{2.4}$ cm downward \nRotation of the 3cm_$\\mathrm{pulley}=>0.33\\ \\mathrm{rad}*3\\mathrm{cm}=1\\mathrm{cm}$ 1upward \nSo a net motion of 1.4 cm downward.\nKinematically, the pulley arrangement is similar to attaching the weight directly to the arm at 14 cm. I infer the guess of 0.1 rad of rotation was a bit low. I update my guess by 30% throughout to:\n#### 0.13 rad (7.5deg) CW rotation of the arm \n0.23 rad (17deg) CCW rotation of the 3cm pulley net motion of 1.8 cm downward of the 1 kg mass as a check I see if the energy stored in the spring equals the energy lost by the mass mgh=0.18J \n$0.5*\\mathbf{K}*\\mathbf{x}\\wedge2=0.5*10*(\\mathbf{N}/\\mathbf{cm})*(0.13*11\\mathbf{cm})\\wedge2=0.19$ close enough.",

      "text": "The machine is operated at rated kVA and at a power factor of 85% lagging (over-excited).This means that the real component of current is $i_{r}=.85$ per-unit and the imaginary component of current is $i_{i}=-\\sqrt{1-.85^{2}}$ . If we note the actual current to be $i_{a}=i_{r}+j i_{i}$ , we can find a point on the quadrature axis: $$e_{1}=v_{t}+(r_{a}+j x_{q})i_{a}$$ This allows us to find the torque angle (just the angle of $e_{1})$ , and then to construct the two components of current: $$\begin{array}{r c l}{{i_{d}}}&{{=}}&{{i_{a}\\sin\\delta-\\psi}}\\ {{i_{q}}}&{{=}}&{{i_{a}\\cos\\delta-\\psi}}\\end{array}$$ The voltage seen by the reactive parts of the machine is inside of the stator resistance: $$v_{a}=v_{t}+r_{a}i_{a}$$ and we may express this as: $$v_{a}=|v_{a}|\\angle v_{a}=|v_{a}|e^{j\theta_{a}}$$ Voltage components are: $$\begin{array}{r l r}{v_{q}}&{=}&{|v_{a}|\\cos{(\\delta+\theta_{a})}}\\ {v_{d}}&{=}&{|v_{a}|\\sin{(\\delta+\theta_{a})}.}\\end{array}$$ Now, the d- and q- axis fluxes are simply: $$\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\psi_{d}}}&{{=}}&{{v_{q}}}\\ {{\\psi_{q}}}&{{=}}&{{-v_{d}}}\\end{array}$$ Air-gap fluxes are simply terminal fluxes plus flux produced by the stator leakeage: $$\begin{array}{r l r}{\\psi_{a d}}&{=\\psi_{k d}=}&{\\psi_{d}+x_{a l}i_{d}}\\ {\\psi_{a q}}&{=\\psi_{k q}=}&{\\psi_{q}+x_{a l}i_{q}}\\end{array}$$ Field flux is air-gap flux on the d- axis plus flux across the field leakage inductance: $$\\psi_{f}=\\psi_{d}+x_{f l}i_{f}$$ where, for the steady state condition: $$i_{f}=\frac{e_{a}}{x_{a d}}$$ This has all been built into a MATLAB script which is appended and which yields the following rendition of numbers: Problem Set 4,Part 1 Terminal Voltage =1 Terminal Current =0.85+ j -0.526783Terminal Current Magnitude = 1Terminal Current Angle =-0.554811radians =-31.7883deg Torque Angle =0.68942radians =39.5009deg Torque Angle =0.68942PF angle =-0.554811Voltage behind sync reactance eq =2.85721Voltage Behind Resistance =1.00493+j -0.00305534D-axis voltage =0.641583Q-Axis voltage =0.773476Terminal Flux psid =0.773476psiq =-0.641583Air-Gap Flux psiad =0.868191psiaq =-0.609504Field Current if =1.36057Field Flux psif =1.43963Torque by generation plus loss =0.8558Torque by flux times current 0.8558Audit Difference = 1.11022e-16",

The latter gives (we are interested only for the case when $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{16}0$ are having the same direction so we don't need to use vectors): (22) $m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})v(^{16}\\mathrm{O})=m(^{12}\\mathrm{C})v(^{12}\\mathrm{C})+m(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})v(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})$ while the conservation of energy gives: $E_{k}(^{16}\\mathrm{O})+Q=E_{k}(^{12}\\mathrm{C})+E_{k}(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})+E_{x}(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})$ (23) where $E_{x}({}^{58}\\mathrm{N i})$ is the excitation energy of $^{58}\\mathrm{N i}$ ,and Qis calculated in the first part of this task.But since $^{12}\\mathsf{C}$ and $^{16}0$ have the same velocity, conservation of momentum reduced to: $\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]v\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)=m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)v\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)$ Now we can easily find the kinetic energy of $^{58}\\mathrm{N i}$ $E_{k}\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)=\\frac{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}{2}=\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{2m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}=\\frac{\\left[\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{2m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}=\\frac{\\left[\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{2m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}=E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}$ and finally the excitation energy of $^{58}\\mathrm{N i}$ $$\\left[\\begin{array}{l}E_{x}\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)=E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+Q-E_{k}\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)-E_{k}\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)=\\\\ =E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+Q-\\frac{m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\cdot^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}{2}-E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}=\\\\ =Q+E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)}{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}-E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}=\\\\ =Q+E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\left[1-\\frac{m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)}{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}-\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]^{2}}{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}\\right]=\\\\ =Q+E_{k}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\frac{\\left[m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]\\cdot\\left[m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)-m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right]}{m\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{N i}\\right)m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}\\end{array}\\right]$ Note that the first bracket in numerator is approximately equal to the mass of transferred particle (the 4He nucleus), while the second one is approximately equal to the mass of target nucleus $^{54}\\mathsf{F e}$ .Inserting the numbers we get: $E_{x}(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})=-0.761+50\\cdot\\frac{(15.99491-12.)(57.93535-15.99491+12.)}{57.93535\\cdot15.99491}=27.$ Relativistic solution In the relativistic version, solution is found starting from the following pair of equations (the first one is the law of conservation of energy and the second one the law of conservation of momentum): $m^{(54}\\mathrm{Fe})\\cdot c^{2}+\\frac{m^{(16}\\mathrm{O})\\cdot c^{2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}(16\\mathrm{O})/c^{2}}}=\\frac{m^{(12}\\mathrm{C})\\cdot c^{2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}(12\\mathrm{C})/c^{2}}}+\\frac{m^{(58}\\mathrm{Ni})\\cdot c^{2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}(58\\mathrm{Ni})/c^{2}}}$ $$\\frac{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot v\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}=\\frac{m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\cdot v\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)/c^{2}}}+\\frac{m^{*}\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)\\cdot v\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)/c^{2}}}$$ All the masses in the equations are the rest masses; the $^{58}\\mathrm{N i}$ is NOT in its ground-state, but in one of its excited states (having the mass denoted with $m^{*})$ .Since $^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{a n d}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ have the same velocity, this set of equations reduces to: $\\left[\\begin{array}{c}m^{(54}\\mathrm{Fe})+\\frac{m^{(16}\\mathrm{O})-m^{(12}\\mathrm{C})}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(16\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}=\\frac{m^{*}\\left(58\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(58\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)/c^{2}}}\\\\ \\frac{\\left(m^{(16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m^{(12}\\mathrm{C})\\right)\\cdot v\\left(16\\mathrm{O}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(16\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}=\\frac{m^{*}\\left(58\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)\\cdot v\\left(58\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(58\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)/c^{2}}}\\end{array}\\right]$ Dividing the second equation with the first one gives: $v\\left(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni}\\right)=\\frac{\\left(m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right)\\cdot v\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}{\\left(m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left(^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right)+m\\left(^{54}\\mathrm{Fe}\\right)\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}$ (30) The velocity of projectile can be calculated from its energy: $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}E_{k i n}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)=\\frac{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}-m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}\\\\ \\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}=\\frac{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}{E_{k i n}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}\\\\ v^{2}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}=1-\\left(\\frac{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}{E_{k i n}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}\\right)^{2}\\\\ v\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)=\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}{E_{k i n}\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)+m\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)\\cdot c^{2}}\\right)^{2}}\\cdot c\\end{array}\\right.$ For the given numbers we get: $\\left[\\nu\\left(^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)=\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{15.99491\\cdot1.6605\\cdot10^{-27}\\cdot\\left(2.9979\\cdot10^8\\right)^2}{50\\cdot1.602\\cdot10^{-13}+15.99491\\cdot\\left(2.9979\\cdot10^8\\right)^2}\\right)^2}\\cdot c=\\sqrt{1-0.99666^2}\\cdot c=0.08172\\cdot c=2.4498\\cdot10^7\\mathrm{km/s}$ Now we can calculate: $v(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})=\\frac{(15.99491-12.0)\\cdot2.4498\\cdot10^{7}\\mathrm{~km/s}}{(15.99491-12.0)+53.93962\\sqrt{1-0.08172^{2}}}=1.6946\\cdot10^{6}\\mathrm{~km/s}$ The mass of $^{58}\\mathrm{{N i}}$ in its excited state is then: $\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{m^{*}\\left({}^{58}\\mathrm{N}i\\right)=\\left(m\\left({}^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)-m\\left({}^{12}\\mathrm{C}\\right)\\right)\\frac{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left({}^{58}\\mathrm{N}i\\right)/c^{2}}}{\\sqrt{1-v^{2}\\left({}^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)/c^{2}}}\\cdot\\frac{v\\left({}^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)}{v\\left({}^{58}\\mathrm{N}i\\right)}=}&{\\left(34\\right)}\\\\ {=\\left(15.99491-12.0\\right)\\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\left(1.6945\\cdot10^{6}/2.9979\\cdot10^{8}\\right)^{2}}}{\\sqrt{1-0.08172^{2}}}\\cdot\\frac{2.4498\\cdot10^{7}}{1.6945\\cdot10^{6}}\\mathrm{a.m.u.}}&{\\left(34\\right)}\\\\ {=57.9470\\mathrm{a.m.u.}}&{\\left(34\\right)}\\end{array}\\right]$ The excitation energy of $^{58}\\mathrm{N i}$ is then: $E_{x}=\\left[m^{*}(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})-m(^{58}\\mathrm{Ni})\\right]\\cdot c^{2}=(57.9470-57.93535)\\cdot1.6605\\cdot10^{-27}\\left(2.9979\\cdot10^{8}\\right)^{2}=\\left[2.00722\\cdot10^{-12}/1.602\\cdot10^{-13}\\mathrm{~MeV}/\\mathrm{J}\\right] = 12.529\\mathrm{~MeV}$ The relativistic and non-relativistic results are equal within 2 keV so both can be considered as correct -we can conclude that at the given beam energy,relativistic effects are not important.",

      "text": "The total angular momentum of the coin about its COM is the sum of the spin angular momentum and precession angular momentum vectors: $$\\vec{L}=\\vec{L}_{s}+\\vec{L}_{\\Omega}$$ The first is straightforward: $$\\vec{L}_{s}=\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}(-\\hat{r}\\cos\\alpha-\\hat{z}\\sin\\alpha)$$ $$\boxed{I_{\\parallel}}$$ The second is not because of the tilt of the coin, which leads to off-axis terms in the moment of inertia tensor (products of inertia). We can get an approximate handle on this by first breaking up the precession rotation vector into components parallel and perpendicular to the disk plane through the center of mass, as shown in the above diagram. Along these principal axes we compute the component angular momenta: $$L_{\\parallel}=I_{\\parallel}\\Omega\\cos\\alpha=\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega\\cos\\alpha $$ $$L_{\\perp}=I_{\\perp}\\Omega\\sin\\alpha=\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\Omega\\sin\\alpha $$ we now have to project these axes back along the polar coordinates: $$\begin{aligned}{}&{{}\\hat{\\parallel}=\\hat{z}\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha-\\hat{r}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha}\\\\ {}&{{}\\hat{\\perp}=\\hat{z}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha+\\hat{r}\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha}\\\\ {}&{{}\\operatorname{w h i c h~g i v e s:}}\\\\ {}&{{}\\vec{L}_{\\Omega}^{{C O M}}=\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega[\\hat{z}(\\operatorname{c o s}^{2}\\alpha+2\\operatorname{s i n}^{2}\\alpha)+\\hat{r}\\operatorname{s i n}\\alpha\\operatorname{c o s}\\alpha]\\approx\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\Omega[\\hat{z}+\\alpha\\hat{r}]}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ where the latter comes from our small angle approximation. Combining this with the spin angular momentum (and keeping the same approximation): $$\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\vec{L}\\approx\frac{1}{4}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\\hat{z}(\frac{b}{R}-2\\alpha)+\\hat{r}(\frac{b}{R}\\alpha-2)]}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\boxed{\\approx\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\\hat{z}(\frac{b}{2R}-\\alpha)-\\hat{r}]}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\approx\frac{1}{2}M b^{2}\\omega_{s}[\frac{b}{2R}(1-\frac{3b\\omega_{s}^{2}}{g})\\hat{z}-\\hat{r}]}\\\\ \\end{array}$$ Note that we retain the assumption made in (c), that the radial angular momentum is primarily from the spin, and that because $\\mathrm{b}<<\\mathrm{R}$ . this component dominates the whole angular momentum vector, making the gyroscopic approximation a realistic one.",

      "text": "Solution. The official solutions are here, but the answer for part 3 has a factor of 2 error, and there are other places where it differs. Stefan Ivanov's solution here is better. Here's a solution adapted for my version of the problem. (a) Note that the particle does not accelerate when it is between the plates, even when $U(t)$ changes, since the electric field vanishes there. The situation is analogous to a ball rolling on a flat table while the entire table is being lifted up. Now consider the particle that enters the plates at time t and exits at time t′. It loses a kinetic energy $e U(t)$ when it enters, then gains a kinetic energy $e U(t^{\\prime})$ when it exits. Therefore, if $U(t)$ is time-dependent, the particle can have a net change in speed, which allows later particles to move faster to D. To make this concrete, let $t_{a}=a/v_{0}$ and $t_{b}=b/v_{0}$ , where $e U_{0}=m v_{0}^{2}/2$ . The approximations of the problem allow us to neglect the particles' change in speed while between the plates,since it's penalized by factors of both $a/b$ and $U(t)/U_{0}$ . Then a particle that enters the plates at time t exits at time $t^{\\prime}\\approx t+t_{a}$ .The extra energy imparted must shorten the time it takes to go from C to D by an amount $t+t_{0}$ , where $t_{0}$ is an arbitrary constant. Then $$t+t_{0}\\approx t_{b}\frac{\\Delta v}{v}\\approx\frac{t_{b}}{2}\frac{\\Delta K}{e U_{0}}\\approx\frac{t_{b}}{2}\frac{U(t+t_{a})-U(t)}{U_{0}}.$$ In other words, the finite difference of $U(t)$ is a linear function of t, which means that $U(t)$ is a quadratic polynomial. The given conditions $U(0)=U^{\\prime}(0)=0{\\mathrm{~f i x~}}U(t)\\propto t^{2}$ , and matching the coefficients of t on both sides gives $$U(t)=\frac{U_{0}}{t_{a}t_{b}}t^{2}=\frac{2e U_{0}^{2}}{a b m}t^{2}.$$",
